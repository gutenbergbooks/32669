<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<div class='cap'>THE Story of John Wesley is one of which the world
does not easily weary. There is perennial freshness
in it. "Age cannot wither it." We may indeed almost
affirm that it has an "infinite variety."</div>

<p>It is specially important that this remarkable history
should be re-told for young people. The youth of England
ought to be fully conversant with John Wesley's unique
personality and immortal work.</p>

<p>John Wesley's name is far above mere denominationalism.
He belongs to all the churches, for he belongs to the
"Holy Catholic Church." He is a great national and
historic figure. It has ever been claimed by some, whose
authority is high, that John Wesley was the saviour of
modern England. Surely there is large truth in this.
The great religious leader was indeed one of the most
potent political forces England has known. If there be
even an approximation towards fact in such a claim, then
how important for young England to know the record of
a man so supremely distinguished.</p>

<p>Certainly, on any ground, these pages meet a distinct
want; and I think it will be the judgment of readers, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
they meet it admirably well. Here John Wesley's life is
traced clearly, even to the point of vividness. The style
in which the story is told, will be found to add to the
intrinsic interest of the recital.</p>

<p>The author of this life of Wesley is thoroughly imbued
with the spirit of her subject, nor does she forget to apply
the lessons, with which this wonderful life-story is crowded.</p>

<p>If the <i>children</i> of our land could be fired with enthusiasm
for the truths John Wesley taught and lived, what a blessed
outlook would there be for England!</p>

<p>We earnestly pray, that many a young reader may be
stirred to the very depths of his being, by the narration
here so attractively given. "'Tis a consummation devoutly
to be wished."</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF JOHN WESLEY.</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Jacky.&mdash;His brothers and sisters.&mdash;His cottage home.&mdash;What
happened to the little pet-dog.&mdash;How Jacky's father forgave the wicked
men of Epworth.&mdash;"Fire! Fire!"</p></div>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 102px;">
<img src="images/cap-l.png" width="102" height="100" alt="L" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />ONG, long ago, more than one hundred
and fifty years, lived the hero of this
book. Because his name was John, everybody
called him Jack or Jacky; and by
everybody I mean his dear, good father and mother,
and his eighteen brothers and sisters. Eighteen, did
I say? Yes, indeed, they counted eighteen; and
seeing there were so many, I will not trouble you
with all their names. I will just tell you three.
Samuel was the eldest, he was the "big brother";
Jacky was number fifteen, and Kitty and Charlie
came after him.</div>

<p>But Jacky did not mind all this houseful, I think he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
rather liked it, for you see he always had plenty of
playmates. His home was in a country village called
Epworth, in Lincolnshire. If you look on your map
I think you will find it. The house was like a big
cottage; the roof had no slates on like ours, but was
thatched with straw, the same as some of the cottages
you have seen in the country; and the windows had
tiny panes of glass, diamond-shaped, and they opened
like little doors. The walls of the cottage were
covered with pretty climbing plants, and what was
best of all, there was a beautiful big garden where
apple and pear trees grew, and where there was lots
of room for Jacky and Charlie and the others to run
about and play "hide and seek."</p>

<p>But I must tell you that a great many wicked
people lived at Epworth, and Jack's father, who was
a minister, tried to teach them how wrong it was to
steal and fight, and do so many cruel things. But his
preaching only made them very angry with good
Mr. Wesley, and one of the men, out of spite, cut off
the legs of his little pet-dog. Was not that a dreadfully
cruel thing to do?</p>

<p>But Jack's father, because he loved Jesus so much,
loved these wicked men, and always forgave them.
He knew if he could get <i>them</i> to love Jesus, they
would soon stop being cruel and unkind.</p>

<p>One night in winter, when everybody was fast
asleep, Kitty woke up feeling something very hot on
her feet. Opening her eyes she was dreadfully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
frightened to see the bedroom ceiling all on fire.
She was only a very little girl, but she jumped out of
bed, and ran to the room where her mother and two
of her sisters were sleeping. Her father, who was
in another room, hearing a great noise outside, and
people calling "Fire! Fire!" jumped up and found
it was his own house that was in flames. Telling the
elder girls to be quick and get dressed and to help
their mother, who was very ill, he ran to the nursery,
and burst open the door. "Nurse, nurse!" he shouted,
"be quick and get the children up, the house is on
fire."</p>

<p>Snatching up baby Charles in her arms, and calling
to the other children to follow her, the nurse hurried
down-stairs. But there they found the hall full of
flames and smoke, and to get out of the front-door
was impossible. So some of the children got through
the windows and some through the back-door into
the garden.</p>

<p>Just as the minister thought he had all his family
safe, he heard a cry coming from the nursery, and on
looking round, he found Jacky was missing. He
rushed into the burning house, and tried to get up the
stairs, but they were all on fire. What should he do?
He didn't know. So he just knelt down in the hall
surrounded by the dreadful flames, and asked God to
take care of little Jack, and if he couldn't be saved to
take him to heaven.</p>

<p>Now I must tell you how it was Jack was still in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the burning house. He had been fast asleep when
the nurse called, and did not hear her and the other
children go out of the room. All at once he woke
up, and seeing a bright light in the room, thought it
was morning. "Nursie, nursie!" he called, "take me
up; I want to get up." Of course there was no answer.
Then he put his head out of the curtains which
surrounded his little bed, and saw streaks of fire on
the top of the room. Oh, how frightened he was!</p>

<p>Jacky was only five years old, but he was a brave
boy, and instead of lying still and screaming and
crying, he jumped up and ran to the door in his
night-gown. But the floor and the stairs were all on
fire. What should he do? He ran back again into
the room, and climbed on a big box that stood near
the window. Then some one in the yard saw him
and shouted: "Fetch a ladder, quick! I see him."</p>

<p>"There's no time," called out somebody else; "the
roof is falling in. Look here!" said the same man,
"I'll stand against this wall, and let a man that's not
very heavy stand on my shoulders, and then we can
reach the child."</p>

<p>So the strong man fixed himself against the wall,
and another man climbed on his shoulders, and Jacky
put out his arms as far as he could, and the man lifted
him out of the burning room, and he was safe. Two
minutes afterwards the roof fell in with a big crash.</p>

<p>Jack was carried into a neighbour's house, and they
all knelt down while the minister thanked God for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
taking care of them, and so wonderfully preserving
all their lives.</p>

<p>Jack never forgot that terrible night, and all his life
afterwards he felt that God had saved him from being
burnt to death, in order that he might do a great deal
of work for Him.</p>

<p>You will not be surprised to hear, that it was the
wicked people in Epworth who had set the minister's
house on fire. But as Jesus forgave His enemies, so
Mr. Wesley forgave these men, and tried more than
ever to show them how much Christ loved them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Jacky learns his A B C.&mdash;A wise mother.&mdash;Christ's little soldier.&mdash;A
chatterbox.&mdash;The big brother and the little one.&mdash;Jacky poorly.&mdash;The
bravest of the brave.&mdash;A proud father.</p></div>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 96px;">
<img src="images/cap-j.png" width="96" height="100" alt="J" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />ACK'S father and mother were not rich
people, and they could not afford to
send all their children to school, so
Mrs. Wesley taught them at home, and
as there were so many of them it was almost like
a proper school. When Jacky was five years old,
he became a little scholar. The first day he learnt
his alphabet, and in three months could read quite
nicely.</div>

<p>Mrs. Wesley was a dear, kind mother, and took
a great deal of trouble, and often put herself to
much pain to train her little boys to be Christian
gentlemen, and her little girls to be Christian ladies.
As soon as they could speak, they were taught to
say their prayers every night and morning, and to
keep the Sabbath day holy. They were never allowed
to have anything they cried for, and they were always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
taught to speak kindly and politely to the servants.
Bad words were never heard among them, and no
loud talking or rough play was allowed. This wise
mother also knew that little people are sometimes
tempted to tell untruths to hide a fault for fear of
punishment, so she made it a rule that if any of the
children did what was naughty, and at once confessed
and promised not to do it again, they should not be
whipped.</p>

<p>One of the little boys&mdash;I'm afraid it was Jacky&mdash;did
not always follow this rule, and so he sometimes
got what he did not like. But Mrs. Wesley never
allowed her children to taunt one another with a fault,
especially when they were trying to do better.</p>

<p>Another thing the children were taught, was to
respect the rights of property; that is, if Jacky
wanted Charlie's top, he was not to take it without
Charlie's leave; and if Emily wanted Sukey's
brooch, she must ask her sister's permission before
taking it.</p>

<p>"Oh, how dreadfully strict!" I fancy I hear some
of my readers say. Not at all, dears, it was a mother's
kindness to her children; for it took far more time,
and a great deal more trouble to teach them all these
things than it would have done to let them do as
they liked. And when Emily and Mollie and Jack
and Charlie and all the others grew up to be men
and women, they thanked God for giving them such
a wise mother.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Once a week Mrs. Wesley used to take each of
the children into her room, separately, for a quiet
little talk. They each had their own day for having
mother <i>all to themselves</i>. Jack had every Thursday,
and Saturday was Charlie's day. So helpful were
these little talks with mother, that years afterwards
when Jack had left home, he wrote and asked his
mother if she would spare the same time every
Thursday to pray for him.</p>

<p>Before Jacky was eight years old he loved Jesus
so much that he wanted every one to know he meant
to be one of His faithful soldiers. So he asked his
father if he might go to the communion, which, you
know, is doing what Christ asked all His followers to
do, taking bread and drinking wine "<i>in remembrance
of Him</i>." Though Jack was such a little boy, his
father knew, by his conduct, that he meant what he
said, and so he admitted him to the Sacrament of the
Lord's Supper. I wish all my young readers could
say, as Jacky could:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"I am a little soldier,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I'm only eight years old,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I mean to fight for Jesus</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And wear a crown of gold.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I know He'll make me happy,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And help me every day,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I'll be His little soldier,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The Bible says I may."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Mrs. Wesley used to have services in her big
kitchen on a Sunday night, for the servants, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the poor people who could not walk all the long
way to church; and little Jack used to sit and listen
so attentively, while his mother told the people how
God's Son was put to death on the cruel cross, to
save them from sin, and to gain for them a place
in heaven.</p>

<p>Jack, like many another little boy, had rather a
long tongue, indeed, he was a regular chatterbox.
His big brother Sam did not always like Jack
putting his word in, and giving his opinion; he
would put him down and say: "Child, don't talk
so much, when you're older you'll find that nothing
much is done in the world by arguing." His father
used to stand up for Jack, and would say: "There's
one thing, our Jack will never do anything without
giving a good reason for doing it, I know."</p>

<p>You will be sorry to hear that Jacky had a dreadful
illness when he was nine years old. It was a disease
that causes a great deal of pain and suffering. But
Jack remembered that a soldier must be brave, and,
as Christ's little soldier, he must be the bravest of the
brave. So Jacky was very patient, and gave his nurse
as little trouble as he could. His mother wrote to
Mr. Wesley, who was in London at the time, and
said, "Jack has borne his illness bravely, like a man,
and like a little Christian, he has never uttered
a word of complaint;" and the father, as he folded
the letter and put it into his pocket, felt proud of
his little son.</p>

</div><div class='unindent'><br />Y and by Jack grew to be a big boy of
eleven, and all this time he had only
been at the home-school. His parents
thought he was now quite old enough
to go to a proper boys' school, and through the
kindness of a friend, he was sent to a big school in
London called the Charterhouse.</div>

<p>Here poor Jacky had a very unhappy time for
two or three years. The big boys took a delight
in bullying the little ones, especially the new-comers;
and as Jack had never been from home before, their
unkindness was hard to bear. Every meal-time each
boy had to go to the cook's house for his allowance
of food, and the big boys used to lay wait for the
little ones as they came out, and snatch away their
meat; so for a long time Jack had nothing but bread
to eat at every meal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Those of my readers who know what boarding-school
life is to-day, will think this a very funny way
of getting your food; and so it was, but, you must
remember, this was in 1714, one hundred and eighty
years ago, and every thing then was very different
to what it is now.</p>

<p>Before Jack went to the Charterhouse, his father
had said to him: "Jack, I should like you to run
round the school garden every morning before breakfast,
it will give you an appetite and help to make
you grow up a strong man." And all the long years
Jack was at school he never failed to obey his father's
wish; and, when he grew up, he said this morning
run had helped to make him the healthy, strong man
he had always been. But, poor little fellow, it was
very hard for him, when, feeling dreadfully hungry
with the fresh air and exercise, the big boys ran off
with his meat, and left him with only some bread for
his breakfast.</p>

<p>However, by and by, Jack grew old enough to
fight for his meat. And when this time came, do
you think he took his turn at stealing from the little
boys, and bullying them? Of course you will all
say: "No, indeed, Jack would never be so mean."
You are right; instead of treating others as others
had treated him, he just did what he thought Jesus
would have done when he was a boy at school.
He stood up for the little fellows, and fought the
big boys who tried to steal their meat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack was so quiet and diligent at school, and so
careful to obey rules, that he soon became a favourite
with the head-master, Dr. Walker; and when he
grew to be a man, he forgot all about the hard
times he had had, and never failed to visit the
Charterhouse once a year.</p>

<p>When Jack had been two years at this school, his
brother Charlie was sent to a school at Westminster,
where his elder brother Samuel was a teacher. Charlie
was then a bright little boy of nine; he was strong,
full of spirit and fun, and afraid of nothing. He
became a great favourite, and was soon looked upon
as the "captain" of the school. Charlie was as
generous as he was brave; his great dream was to
be a good man, and to help others to be good too.</p>

<p>There was a little Scotch laddie at the school
whom all the other boys used to tease and mock.
The captain wouldn't stand this; he took Jamie
under his special protection, shielded him, fought
for him, and saved him from what would otherwise
have been a life of misery.</p>

<p>I fancy I hear you all say: "Bravo, Captain
Charlie!"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 97px;">
<img src="images/cap-w.png" width="97" height="100" alt="W" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />HEN Jack was sixteen he left the Charterhouse
School, and joined Charlie at
Westminster. Here too he was so
diligent and persevering, that when his
brother Samuel wrote home to his father, he said:
"Jack is a brave boy, and learning Hebrew as fast as
he can." The next year he went to Oxford, where
he got on splendidly. He was very witty and lively,
and still <i>very fond of talking;</i> but his was not foolish
talk, and he always took care to stand up for the
right.</div>

<p>At first he was much shocked at the drinking and
gambling, and wickedness of all sorts that went on
among the students at the university. But when day
after day we witness wrong-doing, gradually we get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
less and less shocked, and after a time think little
about it. This only happens though when we get
down from our watch-tower, and the enemy has
a chance to get near to us. Jack's temptations to
join his fellow students were very great, and I am
sorry to say, he got "off his guard," and yielded.
For a time he quite disgraced the colours of his
regiment, and became a deserter from Christ's army.
But it was not for long, he remembered what he had
learnt at home, and how his dear mother had prayed
for him. He remembered how he had been saved
from the burning house, and he felt sure that God
had not spared his life for him to grow up a wicked
or a worldly man.</p>

<p>He had found it hard work to be a Christian at the
Charterhouse School, now he found it harder still at
Christ Church College. He loved fun and merry
company, and this sometimes led him to seek the
society of young men who loved their own pleasure
better than any thing else; and many times Jack,
following their bad example, did things for which he
was afterwards very sorry and very much ashamed.</p>

<p>I have somewhere read this line of poetry:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"The boy that loves his mother<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Is every inch a man,"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>and if ever boy loved his mother, Jack did. The
memory of her loving, holy life was Jack's good
angel; and when temptations proved almost too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
strong for him at Oxford, he wrote and asked her to
pray for him, and to pray on every Thursday. For
Thursday had been Jacky's day with mother, ever
since a little boy he knelt at her knee; and he felt
that his mother's prayers on <i>that</i> day could not fail
to bring down God's blessing upon him, and give
him strength to resist the many evil influences that
surrounded his college life&mdash;and they did.</div>

<p>I told you before, I think, that Jack's parents were
not rich; they had never been able to allow him
much pocket-money, and now at Oxford, when his
expenses were greater, he somehow could never
manage to make his money last out. I am afraid he
was not always as careful as he might have been,
and I am sorry to say when he was spent up&mdash;which
was very often&mdash;he did what so many boys and young
fellows do, borrowed money. This is always foolish,
for, of course, it cannot make things any better, and
indeed only makes them worse; because when the
allowance comes, the debts have to be paid, and there
is little or no money left. However, neither debt nor
being short of money troubled Jack at this time;
indeed he said it was just as well to be poor, for there
were so many rogues at Oxford, that if you carried
anything worth stealing, it was not safe to be out at
night.</p>

<p>One of his friends was once standing at the door of
a coffee-house about seven o'clock in the evening,
and happening to look round, in an instant his hat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and his wig&mdash;they wore wigs in those days&mdash;were
snatched off his head by a thief, who managed to get
clear off with his booty. Jack writing home about
this said: "I am safe from these rogues, for all my
belongings would not be worth their stealing."</p>

<p>When Jack had been four years at Oxford, and
was about twenty-one, his brother Samuel wrote to
tell him he had had the misfortune to break his leg.
He also told him his mother was coming to London,
and if he liked he might go and meet her there.</p>

<p>It was a long, long time since Jack had seen his
mother, and you may imagine his delight when he
got this letter. He wrote back:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Brother Samuel</span>,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sorry for your misfortune, though glad to hear
you are getting better. Have you heard of the Dutch
sailor who having broken one of his legs by a fall from the
mast, thanked God that he had not broken his neck?
I expect you are feeling thankful that you did not break
both legs.</p>

<p>"I cried for joy at the last part of your letter. The two
things I most wished for of almost anything in the world
were to see my mother and Westminster again. But I have
been so often disappointed when I have set my heart on
some great pleasure, that I will never again be sure of anything
before it comes.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">"Your affectionate brother,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Jack.</span>"<br />
</div></div>

<p>Poor Jack! it was well he did not anticipate this
treat too much, for when the time came he hadn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
enough money to take him to London, and as he was
already in debt he could not borrow any more. It
was a bitter disappointment; but when his mother got
back home again after her visit to London, she wrote
one of her bright, loving, encouraging letters, which
did something towards comforting the heart of this
"mother's boy." This was the letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Jack</span>,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am uneasy because I have not heard from you.
Don't just write letter for letter, but let me hear from you
often, and tell me if you are well, and how much you are
still in debt.</p>

<p>"Dear Jack, don't be discouraged; do your duty; keep
close to your studies, and hope for better days. Perhaps
we may be able to send you a few pounds before the end
of the year.</p>

<p>"Dear Jacky, I pray Almighty God to bless thee!</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">"Your mother,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Susanna Wesley.</span>"<br />
</div></div>

<p>When boys get to be fourteen or sixteen, they
begin to think and wonder what they will be when
they are men. Very little boys generally mean to be
either cab-drivers or engine-drivers; and I did hear
of one who meant to have a wild beast show when he
grew up. Jack reached the age of twenty-one, and
had not decided what he would be.</p>

<p>At last the time came when he must make up his
mind. After thinking about it very seriously, he
thought he would like to be a minister like his father.
So he wrote home and told them his decision.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>His father who had been ill and was unable to use
his right hand properly, wrote to him that he must
be quite sure that God had called him to this work
before he undertook it. "At present," he said,
"I think you are too young." Then, referring to his
illness, he said: "You see that time has shaken me by
the hand; and death is but a little behind him. My
eyes and heart are almost all I have left, and I bless
God for them."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wesley was very glad when she heard that her
boy wished to be a minister. "God Almighty direct
and bless you," she wrote to him.</p>

<p>A few months afterwards, Jack's father wrote, and
told him that he had changed his mind about his being
too young, and that he would like him to "take
Orders," that is, to become a minister, the following
summer. "But in the first place," he said, "if you
love yourself or me, pray very earnestly about it."</p>

<p>To choose to be Christ's minister, a preacher of the
gospel, Mr. Wesley knew was a very solemn and
responsible choice, and he wished Jack to think very
seriously, and to pray very earnestly before he took
the important step.</p>

</div><div class='unindent'><br /> &nbsp; WONDER if any of my readers ever
think what the books they read are doing
for them, especially the books they are
most fond of? Do you know every book
you read makes <i>you</i> a little bit different? By <i>you</i>,
I mean the unseen part of you, your mind and
character.</div>

<p>I remember, when I was somewhere about the
mischievous age of eight or nine, how fond I used
to be of getting to the putty round a newly-put-in
window pane. It was lovely to press my thimble
on it, and see all the pretty little holes it left; or
to push a naughty finger deep down into the nice
soft stuff. Then, when the putty had dried hard,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
I used to look with great interest on my work, for
every impression was there, and could not now be
removed.</p>

<p>So it is with books, they make an <i>impression</i> on
you; and you are either a little bit better or a little
bit worse for every book you read. <i>Take care only
to read those books that will make you better.</i></p>

<p>The summer after Jack decided to be a minister,
he read two books which made some big impressions
on his mind, and left him <i>better</i> than he was before
reading them. One was called "The Imitation of
Christ," and the other "Holy Living and Dying."
They taught him that true religion must be in the
heart, and that it is not enough for our words and
actions, as seen and heard by men, to be right, but
our very thoughts must be pure and good, such as
would be approved of God. He did not at all agree
with Thomas &agrave; Kempis, the writer of the first book
I mentioned, in everything, though, for he made out,
according to Jack's idea, that we should always be
miserable.</p>

<p>I think Jack would never have persevered in his
determination to follow Christ, if he had been convinced
that "to be good you must be miserable,"
for he loved fun, and could not help being happy.
He felt sure Thomas &agrave; Kempis was mistaken,
especially when he remembered that verse in the
Bible which says religion's ways "are ways of
<i>pleasantness</i>" (Prov. iii. 17). When he wrote home, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
asked his mother what she thought, for although
he was now a young man of twenty-two, he was
still the old Jack that thought father and mother
knew better than anybody else.</p>

<p>His mother wrote back that she thought Thomas
&agrave; Kempis <i>was</i> mistaken, for so many texts in the
Bible show us that God intends us to be happy and
full of joy. "And," she said, "if you want to know
what pleasures are right and wrong, ask yourself:
'Will it make me love God more, and will it help
me to be more like my great example, Jesus
Christ?'"</p>

<p>Jack's father wrote: "I don't altogether agree
with Thomas &agrave; Kempis; but the world is like a
siren, and we must beware of her. If the young
man would rejoice in his youth, let him take care
that his pleasures are innocent; and in order to do
this, remember, my son, that for all these things God
will bring us into judgment."</p>

<p>Some of my readers will hardly understand what
Mr. Wesley meant when he said the world is "like
a siren." Most of you have read fairy tales; well,
a kind of Greek fairy story tells of some beautiful
maidens, called sirens, who used to sit on some
dangerous rocks, and play sweetest music. When
sailors saw them and heard their singing, they
were drawn by magic nearer and nearer to where
they were, until at last their boats struck on the
rocks, and the poor deluded sailors were dragged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
by the sirens to the bottom of the sea and were
drowned.</p>

<p>Now, do you see why the world is like a siren?
Its pleasures all look so beautiful that we are tempted
to draw nearer and nearer, until at last we are lost
to all that is holy and good.</p>

</div><div class='unindent'><br />E all love to get letters, do we not? though
some of us are not so fond of writing
them. It was in the year 1725, when
Jack was twenty-two years old, that he
became a minister; and just about this time he had
a beautiful letter from his father. In it Mr. Wesley
said:&mdash;</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"God fit you for your great work. Watch and pray;
believe, love, endure, and be happy, towards which you
shall never want the most ardent prayers of</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">"Your affectionate father,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Samuel Wesley.</span>"<br />
</div></div>

<p>Jack's first sermon was preached at a small town
near Oxford, and his second at his dear home-village,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Epworth. Mr. Wesley was getting old, and as he
had now two churches to look after, the one at
Epworth and another at a place called Wroote, where
he and Mrs. Wesley had gone to live, he was very
glad when his son offered to go and help him. And
now that Jack has grown up and got to be a proper
minister, I think we must begin to call him Mr. John.
Well, Mr. John stayed some time helping his father
at Wroote and Epworth, and then went back again
to Oxford, to study for a place in a college there&mdash;Lincoln
College.</p>

<p>There were several others trying to get this same
place, and they didn't like Mr. John because he
would not do the wicked things they did, so they
made great fun of him, and laughed at him for
being good. Nobody likes being laughed at; and
Mr. John didn't, but he bore it bravely; and his
father comforted him when he wrote: "Never mind
them, Jack; he is a coward that cannot bear being
laughed at. Jesus endured a great deal more for
us, before He entered glory; and unless we follow
His steps we can never hope to share that glory with
Him. Bear it patiently, my boy, and be sure you
never return evil for evil." His mother, too, sent
loving letters to cheer and comfort him.</p>

<p>So Mr. John worked hard, and bore his persecutions
patiently&mdash;<i>for Jesus' sake;</i> and in spite of all his
enemies he won the coveted place, and became Fellow
of Lincoln College. Oh, how glad and thankful he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
was! And his father and mother were so proud and
happy.</p>

<p>It was just about this time that Mr. Wesley was
afraid he would have to leave Wroote, and it was
a great trouble to him. "But," he said, proudly,
"wherever I am, my Jacky is Fellow of Lincoln."
As for Jack, he felt it was worth everything to give
his father and mother such pleasure.</p>

<p>Though he was properly grown up, twenty-three
years old, Mr. and Mrs. Wesley always thought of
him as their "boy." Fathers and mothers always
do this. It doesn't matter how old their children
grow to be, they love to think of them, and speak
of them as their "boys" and "girls." Dear readers,
remember there is no one on earth that loves you,
or ever will love you with such a big love as father
and mother. No matter how tall, or how strong, or
how clever you may grow, they will always love you
with the same big love they did when you were little
boys and girls. And, oh! whatever you do, never,
never grieve these dearest of all dear friends.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wesley had been longing to see her "boy"
again, especially now that he had become Fellow
of Lincoln College. At last her wish was granted.
There were a great many things that puzzled Jack
which he wanted to ask his father and mother about.
So he went and spent a long summer at home, getting
his hard questions answered, and helping his father
with the work that was now almost too much for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
him. He had such a happy time that he was almost
sorry when the autumn came and he had to return
to Oxford.</p>

<p>Being at school and college costs a great deal
of money, and Jack knew that his father was not
a rich man, and that he had hard work often to pay
his college expenses. Jack had been very sorry to
be such a burden to his parents, and tried to be as
careful as he could. Have you ever seen a picture
of Mr. John Wesley? If you have, you will have
noticed his long hair. Every one at Oxford wore
their hair short; but having it cut cost money, and
John used to say: "I've no money to spend on hair-dressers."
So, though his fellow-students made great
fun of him, he saved his money and wore his hair
long, and in time got so accustomed to it, that he
wore it long all his life. Now that he was Fellow
of Lincoln College he received enough money to
pay his own expenses, and it made him very happy
to think he need no longer be an expense to his dear
father. But he resolved still to be as careful as he
could, and never again to go into debt.</p>

<p>When he went back to his new College, after
spending the summer at home, he said to himself:
"I will give up all the old friends who have so often
tempted me to do things that a Christian ought not
to do, and I will make new friends of those who will
help me on my way to heaven." So, though he was
always polite to the many worldly young men who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
wanted to make his acquaintance, he would not have
them for his friends. This made some of them say
very unkind things about him; but Mr. John bore
it all quietly, and never said unkind things back
again. He felt he was only treading the path Jesus
had trod before him, the path which all His disciples
must follow.</p>

<p>Mr. John got to be so clever that soon he was
made professor, or teacher of Greek. Some boys
and girls&mdash;yes, and grown-up people, too&mdash;become
proud when they get to be clever, but Mr. John did
not. He determined, more than ever, to be a faithful
and humble follower of the Lord Jesus. He was
very patient with his scholars, and tried not only to
make them learned, but to make them Christians.
"I want these young soldiers of Christ to be burning
and shining lights wherever they may go," he said.
"If they are not all intended to be clergymen, they
are all intended to be Christians."</p>

<p>In the beginning of the next year (1727), Mr. John
went home again to help his father, who was getting
very old, and was often ill. He stayed at Wroote about
two years, and then went back again to Oxford.</p>

He stayed nine years at Westminster, and then, when
he was eighteen, went to one of the colleges at
Oxford. It was not the one Mr. John was at, but,
being in the same town, the two brothers often saw
each other.</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Charlie was not a Christian, and made companions
of the worldly young students who spent their
time in all sorts of wrong-doings. John was very
sorry for this, and spoke to him about it; but
Charlie became very angry at what he called his
brother's interference, and said: "Do you want me to
become a saint all at once?"</p>

<p>However, while Mr. John was away at home those
two years helping his father, Charlie changed very
much. He became steadier and more thoughtful,
and even wrote to his brother, and asked for the
advice he would not have before. "I don't exactly
know how or when I changed," he said in his letter;
"but it was soon after you went away. It is owing,
I believe, to somebody's prayers (my mother's most
likely) that I am come to think as I do."</p>

<p>When boys and girls or grown-up people become
Christians, those around them soon find it out.
Charlie's giddy companions soon saw something was
wrong with him. He used to be lazy and shirk
his studies, spending his time with them in pleasure
and amusement, now he was diligent and worked
hard.</p>

<p>The next thing they noticed was that he went to
church regularly and took the Sacrament. And here
I must tell you how he behaved towards these friends,
and I know it will make you like Charlie more than
ever.</p>

<p>I told you before how loving and genial he was,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
and now he did not at all like to give up his old
chums, and yet he knew that if he meant to travel
heavenwards he must have companions that were
going the same way. He longed for his friends to
become Christians, and talked to them so lovingly
and so wisely that before very long he got two or
three of them to join him in fighting against the evils
of their nature, and encouraging and seeking after
everything that was good.</p>

<p>You have all read in your English history how
good King Alfred the Great divided his time; well,
Charles and his companions divided theirs in a similar
way. So many hours were spent in study, so many
in prayer, and so many in sleeping and eating. They
made other strict rules for themselves, and lived so
much by what we call "method," that at last they
got to be called "Methodists."</p>

<p>Boys and girls are very fond of giving nicknames
to their companions; sometimes it is done in fun, and
then there is no harm in it,&mdash;but often spite and ill-nature
suggest the nickname, then it is very wrong
and very unkind.</p>

<p>Most of the young men at Oxford thought religion
and goodness were only things to make fun of, so
Charles and his friends were a butt for their ridicule.
Because they read their Bibles a great deal they
called them "Bible Bigots," and "Bible Moths," and
their meetings they called the "Holy Club."</p>

<p>But "Methodists" was the name that fastened most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
firmly to them, and, as you know, after all these years,
this is the name we call ourselves by to-day. Just
think; a nickname given to a few young men at
Oxford, more than one hundred and fifty years ago,
is now held in honour by hundreds of thousands
of people all over the world.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 97px;">
<img src="images/cap-w.png" width="97" height="100" alt="W" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />HEN Mr. John came back to Oxford,
of course he joined the Christian band,
and very soon they made him their
leader. He was cleverer and had more
experience than the others, and they all looked up to
him for help and advice. Others joined the club, and
soon there were twenty-five members.</div>

<p>Do you remember a verse in the Bible that,
speaking of Jesus, says: "He went about doing
good"? Well, these young men who were taking
Jesus for their copy, just did the same; all their
spare time was spent in "doing good." Some of
them tried to rescue their fellow-students from bad
companions and get them to become Christians;
others visited and helped the poor. Some taught the
children in the workhouse, and some got leave to go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
into the prison and read to the prisoners. Very few
of them were rich, but they denied themselves things
they really wanted in order to buy books, and
medicine for the poor. Every night they used to
have a meeting to talk over what they had done, and
settle their work for the next day.</p>

<p>Mr. John started a school for poor little children;
he paid a teacher to teach them, and bought clothes
for the boys and girls whose parents could not afford
to buy them. Once a little girl from the school called
to see Mr. John. It was a cold winter's day, and she
was very poorly clad.</p>

<p>"You seem half starved, dear," he said; "have
you nothing to wear but that cotton frock?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," she answered; "this is the only frock
I have."</p>

<p>Mr. John put his hand into his pocket, but, alas! he
found no money there, it had all gone. Just then
he caught sight of the pictures on the walls of his
room, and he thought: "How can I allow these
beautiful pictures to hang here while Christ's poor are
starving?"</p>

<p>We are not told, but I think we can be quite sure
that the pictures were sold, and that the little girl got
a warm winter's frock.</p>

<p>Mr. John was just as careful of his time as his
money, he never wasted a moment. He believed
in the proverb you have often heard: "Early to bed
and early to rise." Some people say: "Get up with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the lark," but I think Mr. John was always up before
that little bird even awoke. Every morning when
the clock struck four he jumped out of bed, and
began his work. Wasn't that early? I wonder
which of us would like to get up at that time? And
he did not do this only when he was young, he did it
all his life, even when he was an old, old man.</p>

<p>I told you these "Methodists" made rules for
themselves. One of them was to set apart special
days for special prayer for their friends and pupils.
And another one which we all should copy was:
<span class="smcap">Never to speak unkindly of any one</span>. The
Bible was their Guide Book, and it told them, as it
will tell us, all they ought to do, and all they ought
not to do.</p>

</div><div class='unindent'><br />ILL you look on your map of England
and find London? Now find Oxford.
The two places are a long way apart, are
they not?</div>

<p>Well, do you know Mr. John and Mr. Charles
Wesley used often to walk all that long way to see
a friend. You know there were no railways in those
days, and to go by coach cost a great deal of money.
This friend's name was Mr. Law; he was a very good
man, and encouraged and helped the two brothers
very much. He taught them that "religion is the
simplest thing in the world." He said: "It is just
this, 'We love Jesus, because Jesus first loved us.'"</p>

<p>At Oxford, the Methodists were still called all sorts
of names and made great fun of, not only by the idle,
wicked students, but even by clever and learned men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
who ought to have known better. Some of their
enemies said: "They only make friends with those
who are as queer as themselves." But Mr. John
showed them this was not true, for in every way he
could he helped and showed kindness to those who
said the most unkind things.</p>

<p>Hard work, close study, and fasting, at last made
Mr. John very ill; one night he thought he was going
to die. He was not at all afraid, he just prayed,
"O God, prepare me for Thy coming." But God had
a great deal of work for His servant to do, and did
not let him die. With care and a doctor's skill he
got quite better.</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Wesley was often anxious about her two
Oxford sons, and once wrote them quite a scolding
letter. "Unless you take more care of yourselves,"
she said, "you will both be ill. You ought to know
better than to do as you are doing." Mrs. Wesley
did not agree with them fasting so much; she believed
God meant us to take all the food necessary to
support our bodies.</p>

<p>Just about this time, Mr. Samuel&mdash;the big brother&mdash;got
an appointment as master of a boys' school somewhere
in the West of England; but before he went to
his new place he thought he would like to go home,
and see his dear father and mother.</p>

<p>When his brothers at Oxford heard this, they
thought they would go too, so that they might all be
together in the old home once more. And, oh, what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
a happy time they had! Mr. Wesley was getting very
old, and he was so proud to have his "boys" with
him again. He talked very seriously to John and
Charles, and told them he did not at all approve of
their way of living. He said he was sure God never
meant us to fast so much as to injure our health, or
to shut ourselves up and be so much alone. Jesus
said: "Let your light shine <i>before men;</i>" our light
should be where <i>everybody</i> can see it. I am sure old
Mr. Wesley was right.</p>

<p>A few months later, and the brothers were again at
Wroote, standing by the bedside of their dying
father. "I am very near heaven," he said, as they
gathered round him, "Good-bye!" And "father"
went Home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A corner in America.&mdash;Wanted a missionary.&mdash;Mrs. Wesley gives
up her sons to God's work.&mdash;At the dock-side.&mdash;The good ship
"Simmonds."&mdash;Life on board.&mdash;A terrible storm.&mdash;The German
Christians who were not afraid.</p></div>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/cap-i.png" width="100" height="100" alt="I" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />F you look on your map of the United
States, you will see in the south-east,
a little corner called Georgia. It was to
this place that a number of poor people
from England had emigrated; people who had been
cruelly treated in prison, and on being released had
no work to do and nowhere to go. Some kind
Christian gentlemen collected money to help them to
get to Georgia, where they could have plenty of
work and plenty of food. A number of poor
Germans, too, who had been persecuted in their own
country because of their religion, also went out to
this place where they could worship God as they
chose, without fear of cruel treatment.</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>When people are driven out of their own country
like this, they are called "exiles," and though this
little band of exiles found work and food, and
freedom to worship God in the new land, they had no
minister. So the gentlemen who had raised the
money, and who knew what brave, good men
Mr. John and Mr. Charles Wesley were, asked them
if they would go out and minister to these poor
people in Georgia. "You are just the men to comfort
and teach them," they said.</p>

<p>Then, too, a number of Indians lived in Georgia,
and they wanted to be friends with the white strangers,
and General Oglethorpe and Dr. Burton, the gentlemen
I mentioned, thought it would be a good
opportunity to preach the gospel to them.</p>

<p>When Mr. John Wesley was first asked, he said:
"No, I cannot go, I cannot leave my mother." Then
they said: "Will you go if your mother gives her
consent?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said John, feeling quite sure she would
never give it.</p>

<p>So he went to Epworth and told his mother all
about the matter. Then he waited for her reply.
Mrs. Wesley loved her "boy" John very, very dearly,
and if he went to America she might never see him
again, and yet her answer came: "If I had twenty
sons, I would give them all up for such a work."</p>

<p>Even after obtaining this unexpected consent,
John did not decide to go until he had asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the advice of his brother Samuel and his friend
Mr. Law, both of whom advised him to undertake
the work. Then both he and his brother sent in
their decision to General Oglethorpe, and began
making preparations for their long journey across
the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>Now I want us to imagine ourselves at Gravesend,
a place on the river Thames near London. Look at
all those ships in the docks! See, there is one that
looks just ready to sail! Can you read the name of
it? "S&nbsp;i&nbsp;m&nbsp;m&nbsp;o&nbsp;n&nbsp;d&nbsp;s"&mdash;"Simmonds." Yes, that is its
name. Let us button up our coats, as it is a sharp
October day, and watch the passengers go on board.</p>

<p>Look at that little man with the nice face, and
a lot of colour in his cheeks! What long hair he
has! and how smooth it is! It looks as if he brushed
it a great deal. See, he is looking this way, and we
can notice his beautiful forehead and his bright eyes.
Why that must be Mr. John Wesley! And, of
course, that is his brother Charles talking to some
gentlemen on the deck. See, he is holding a book
close to his eyes&mdash;he must be short-sighted. Listen,
how the others are laughing! I expect he is making
a joke. Now he is walking off arm in arm with one
of his companions. He seems to be still loving-hearted
and full of fun, the same Charlie he was at
Westminster School only grown big.</p>

<p>A number of Germans were also on board the
"Simmonds," all bound for Georgia. Before they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
had been many days at sea, John Wesley found out
that they were earnest Christians, and he began at
once to learn German in order that he might talk to
them.</p>

<p>The brothers had not taken their father's advice
about fasting; they and some other Methodists who
were their fellow-passengers still thought they ought
to do with as little food as possible, and with as few
comforts. They ate nothing but rice, biscuits, and
bread, and John Wesley slept on the floor. He was
obliged to do it one night, because the waves got into
the ship and wet his bed, and because he slept so well
that night, he thought the floor was good enough for
him, and continued to sleep on it.</p>

<p>I expect you wonder how they spent their time
during the long, long voyage to Georgia. I will tell
you. They made the same strict rules for themselves
that they did at Oxford. They got up every morning
at four o'clock, and spent the time in private prayer
until five o'clock. Then they all read the Bible
together until seven. After that they had breakfast,
and then public prayers for everybody on the ship
who would come. Then from nine to twelve&mdash;just
your school-time, little readers, is it not?&mdash;Mr. John
studied his German; somebody else studied Greek,
another taught the children on board, and Mr.
Charles wrote sermons. Then at twelve o'clock they
all met and told each other how they had been
getting along, and what they had been doing. At<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
one o'clock they had dinner, and after that they read
or preached to those on board until four o'clock.
Then they studied and preached and prayed again
until nine, when they went to bed. Were not these
strict rules? I wonder if they ever had the headache?
I am afraid we should, if we studied so hard
and so long.</p>

<p>Have you ever been to Liverpool, and seen one
of those beautiful vessels that go to America?
They are as nice and as comfortable as the best of
your own homes, and you can get to the other side of
the Atlantic in about ten days. But at the time of
which I write, more than one hundred and fifty years
ago, travelling was very different. The ships were
much smaller, and tossed about a great deal more,
and the passengers had to put up with a great many
discomforts. Then again, it took weeks, instead of
days, to get across to America.</p>

<p>The passengers on board the "Simmonds" met
with some terrible storms; often the great waves
would dash over their little ship, until it seemed as if
it must sink and never rise again.</p>

<p>One of these storms began on a Sunday, about
twelve o'clock in the middle of the day. The wind
roared round them, and the waves, rising like
mountains, kept washing over and over the decks.
Every ten minutes came a shock against the side of
the boat, that seemed as if it would dash the planks
in pieces.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>During this storm as Mr. Wesley was coming out
of the cabin-door, a big wave knocked him down.
There he lay stunned and bruised, until some one
came to his help. When he felt better, he went and
comforted the poor English passengers, who were
dreadfully afraid, and were screaming and crying in
their fear. Then he went among the Germans, but
they needed no comfort from him. He heard them
singing as he got near, and found them calm and
quiet, not the least bit frightened.</p>

<p>"Were you not afraid?" Mr. Wesley asked them
when the storm was over.</p>

<p>"No," they answered, "we are not afraid to
die."</p>

<p>"But were not the children frightened?" he said.</p>

<p>"No," they said again, "our children are not afraid
to die either."</p>

<p>During that terrible storm they had remembered
how Jesus stilled the tempest on the Lake of Galilee,
and His voice seemed to say to them now: "Peace,
be still."</p>

<p>This reminds me of a piece of poetry, which I dare
say some of you have read. It is about a little girl
whose father was a captain, and once when there was
an awful storm, and even the captain himself was
frightened:</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"&mdash;&mdash;his little daughter</span><br />
Took her father by the hand,<br />
And said: 'Is not God upon the water<br />

</div><div class='unindent'><br />T last storms and dangers were over, and
the good ship "Simmonds" floated safely
in the smooth waters of the Savannah
river. You can find this on your map.
They cast anchor near a little island called Tybee
Island, where beautiful pine trees grew all along the
shore.</div>

<p>The first thing they did on landing was to go to
the top of a hill, kneel down together, and thank God
for bringing them safely across the ocean. You
remember Noah's first act after leaving the ship that
God put him into when the world was drowned, was
to offer a sacrifice of thankfulness for God's care over
him. And when Abraham got safely into the strange
land to which God sent him, the first thing he did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
was to offer sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. In
the same way the little missionary band from England
showed their reverence and gratitude to the God who
rules earth, sky, and sea.</p>

<p>When they got to the town of Savannah they
found it a very small place. There were only about
forty houses, besides a church, a prison built of logs
of wood, and a mill where everybody took their corn
to be ground.</p>

<p>I told you, if you remember, that besides the poor
English exiles there were a number of German
Christians. These were called Moravians, and they
were so glad to have a minister that they came to
meet Mr. Wesley, and told him how pleased they
were to see him. Mr. Wesley and one of his friends
lived with them in Savannah for a long time, and
they soon found what earnest real Christians they were,
true followers of the Lord Jesus. You know it is the
people you live with that know you the best, and this
is what Mr. Wesley wrote about these Moravians.
"We were in the same room with them from morning
till night, except when we went out for a walk. They
were never idle, were always happy, and always kind
to one another. They were true copies in all things
of their Saviour Jesus Christ." Was not that a
splendid character to have, and would it not be nice
if those whom we live with could say the same of us?</p>

<p>There was something near Savannah that you
would have liked to see, especially the boys, and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
was an Indian town. If there was one thing more
than another that drew Mr. Wesley to Georgia it was
the Indians. I expect, like you, he had loved to read
and hear about them; now he had a chance to see
them. But what he longed for most of all was to
tell them about Jesus, and to get them to become
Christians. The Indians lived in tents or tepees as
they are called, and a number of these tepees all put
up close together was called a town; one of these
towns was only about twenty minutes' walk from
Savannah.</p>

<p>After Mr. Wesley had been a week or two in
America, who should come to see him but the Indian
chief. Think how excited Mr. Wesley would be!
The chief's name was Tomo Chachi, and he came
looking so grand in all his war paint, with his great
feather head-dress, and moccasins made of buffalo
skin, ornamented with pretty coloured beads, just
as you have seen them in pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. Wesley thought he must dress up too, to
receive his distinguished visitor, so he put on his
gown and cassock, and down he went to see Tomo
Chachi. Of course Mr. Wesley did not understand
the Indian language, but there was a woman who did,
and she acted as interpreter. "I am glad you are
come," said Tomo Chachi. "I will go up and speak
to the wise men of our nation, and I hope they will
come and hear you preach."</p>

<p>Then Tomo Chachi's wife, or squaw as she is called,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
who had come with her husband, presented the
missionaries with a jar of milk. She meant by this
that she wanted them to make the story of Jesus
Christ very plain and simple so that they could
understand it, for she said "we are only like children."
Then she gave them a jar of honey, and by this
she meant that she hoped the missionaries would
be very sweet and nice to them. Then Tomo Chachi
and his squaw went back to their tepee.</p>

<p>A few months after, Mr. Wesley had a long talk
with another tribe of Indians, a very wicked tribe
called the Chicasaws; but they would not allow him
to preach to them. They said: "We don't want
to be Christians, and we won't hear about Christ."
So Mr. Wesley had to leave them and go back
disappointed to Savannah.</p>

plainly made, but very clean and tidy. After
admiring herself a little while, Edie turned to Annie
and thinking, I suppose, that she might be wearing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
a pinafore, and have a frock underneath, she rudely
lifted it up, and finding it really was her dress, she
turned away with a very ugly, disgusted look on
her face, and said, scornfully "What a frock!"
Proud, thoughtless boys and girls never know the
hurts they give, and the harm they do.</p>

<p>The boys in Georgia were no better than some
boys in England. At a school where one of the
Methodists taught there were some poor boys
who wore neither shoes nor stockings, and their
companions who were better off taunted them and
made their lives miserable. Their teacher did not
know what to do, and asked Mr. Wesley for advice.
"I'll tell you what we'll do," he said; "we'll change
schools"&mdash;Mr. Wesley taught a school too&mdash;"and I'll
see if I can cure them."</p>

<p>So the two gentlemen changed schools, and when
the boys came the next morning they found they had
a new teacher, and this new teacher, to their astonishment,
wore neither shoes nor stockings. You can
imagine how the boys stared; but Mr. Wesley said
nothing, just kept them to their lessons. This went
on for a week, and at the end of that time the boys
were cured of their pride and vanity.</p>

<p>Though Mr. John and Mr. Charles Wesley were
so good, they were not perfect. They said and did
many unwise things, and only saw their mistake
when it was too late. One thing was they expected
the people to lead the same strict lives they did, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
to believe everything they believed. This, of course,
the people of Georgia would not do, they thought
their ways were just as good as Mr. Wesley's, and
I dare say in some things they were. Instead of
trying to persuade them and explaining why one way
was better than another, Mr. Wesley told them they
<i>must</i> do this, and they mustn't do that, until at last
they got to dislike him very much. One woman got
so angry that she knocked him down.</p>

<p>I am sure you will all feel very sorry when you
read this, for Mr. Wesley was working very hard
amongst them, and thought he was doing what was
right. Mr. Charles did not get on any better at
Frederica, where he had gone to work and preach.
Like his brother, he was very strict and expected too
much from the people. He tried and tried, not
seeing where he was to blame, and at last wearied
and disappointed he returned to England.</p>

<p>After he had gone, Mr. John took his place at
Frederica, hoping to get on better than he had done
at Savannah. It was of no use; he stayed for twelve
weeks, but things only seemed to get worse and
worse. At last he had to give up and go back to
Savannah. Things, however, were no better there,
and before long he too began to see that his mission
had been a failure, and he returned to England
a sadder and a wiser man.</p>

<p>In spite of all their mistakes Mr. John and his
brother must have done some good in Georgia, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the missionary who went after them wrote and said:
"Mr. Wesley has done much good here, his name
is very dear to many of the people." It must have
made the brothers glad to read this, for it is hard
when you have been doing what you thought was
right, and then find it was all wrong.</p>

<p>On his return voyage to England Mr. Wesley had
time to think about all the things that happened in
Georgia. He was feeling dreadfully disappointed
and discouraged; he had given up everything at
home on purpose to do good to the people out there.
He had meant to convert the Indians and comfort
and help the Christian exiles, and he was coming
back not having done either. Poor Mr. Wesley!
And the worst of it was, the more he thought about
it all, the more he began to see that the fault was his
own.</p>

<p>There was another thing he discovered about himself
on that voyage home. They encountered a fearful
storm, when every one expected to be drowned.
During those awful hours Mr. Wesley found out,
almost to his own surprise, that the very thought
of death was a terror to him. He knew then that
there was something wrong, for no Christian ought to
fear to die. So Mr. Wesley went down on his knees
and told God how wrong he had been, that he had
thought too much of his own opinions and trusted
too much in himself. He asked God to give him
more faith, more peace, more love.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>He was always glad afterwards that he had gone
to Georgia, and thanked God for taking him into that
strange land, for his failure there had humbled him
and shown him his weakness and his failings.</p>

<p>It is a grand thing when we get to know ourselves.
Let us be always on the look-out for our own faults,
and when we see them, fight them.</p>

<p>I would like to close this chapter with an acrostic
I once heard on the word "Faith." It is a thing little
folks, yes, and big folks often find hard to understand,
perhaps this may help you.</p>

<p>What is Faith?</p>

<img src="images/cap-y.png" width="101" height="100" alt="Y" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />OU remember the Holy Club which the
Methodists started at Oxford? Well,
one of the youngest members was named
George Whitefield; he was a pupil of
Mr. John Wesley's, and when he left Oxford he
became a preacher. While the two Wesleys were
in Georgia, he carried on their work in England.
He had learnt to love Jesus very dearly, had felt
how wicked and sinful he was, and had gone to the
Saviour and told Him all, asking Him to "Create
in him a clean heart, and to renew within him a right
spirit." Then he was so happy in knowing he was
forgiven, that he wanted every one else to be happy
and forgiven too. He was so young when he commenced
to preach that every one called him the
"boy parson;" but he talked so earnestly and kindly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
to the people that crowds everywhere flocked to
hear him.</div>

<p>When he heard that the two Wesleys were leaving
Georgia he determined to go and take their place, and
see what he could do for the poor exiles. Before
he left England he preached a good-bye sermon,
and told the people that he was going this long
and dangerous voyage, and perhaps they might never
see his face again. When they heard this, the
children and the grown-up people, rich and poor,
burst into tears, they loved him so much. But as
this book is to be about Mr. John Wesley, we must
not follow Mr. Whitefield across the Atlantic. Try
to remember his name though, for he and the Wesleys
were life-long friends, and you will hear about him
again further on.</p>

<p>When Mr. John and Mr. Charles got back to
England they took up George Whitefield's work,
going from town to town telling the people about
Jesus Christ. As there were no railways they had
to walk a great deal, and they used to speak to
the people they met on the roads and in the
villages through which they passed. Once, when
Mr. Wesley and a friend were on their way to
Manchester, they stayed one night in an inn at
Stafford. Before they went to bed, Mr. Wesley
asked the mistress of the house if they might have
family prayer. She was quite willing, and so all the
servants were called in. Next morning, after breakfast,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Mr. Wesley had a talk with them all again, and
even went into the stables and spoke to the men
there about their sins and about the love of Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p>He preached in Manchester the next Sunday, and
this was his text: "If any man be in Christ, he is
a new creature" (2 Cor. v. 17). He explained to
them that when any one begins to love Jesus, and
tries to copy His life, they grow more and more like
what He was. Then everything becomes different;
the things they loved to do before cease to be a
pleasure to them, and the places they liked to go
to they no longer care to visit; they are "<i>new
creatures</i> in Christ Jesus."</p>

<p>The next morning (Monday) Mr. Wesley, and the
friend who was with him, left Manchester and went
on to Knutsford. Here, too, the people listened
attentively, while they preached the gospel of Jesus
Christ. They visited other towns, and then Mr. Wesley
returned to Oxford.</p>

<p>He had not been long there when he heard that
his brother Charles was very ill in London, and went
at once to see him. Charles Wesley had been living
and working there with some German Christians, or
Moravians, as they were called, and before long he
found that these people had something in their lives
that he did not possess. Like the Germans he met
in Georgia, their religion gave them peace and joy
on week-days as well as on Sundays.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>When he was ill, one of these Moravians, named
Peter B&ouml;hler, came to see him. During the little
talk they had, the visitor said:</p>

<p>"What makes you hope you are saved?"</p>

<p>"Because I have done my best to serve God,"
answered Mr. Charles.</p>

<p>You see, he was trusting in all the good deeds he
had done, and not on Jesus Christ's suffering and
death for him.</p>

<p>Mr. B&ouml;hler shook his head, and did not say any
more then. But he left Charles Wesley longing for
the something he had not got.</p>

<p>When he was a little better, he was carried to the
house of a poor working-man named Bray. He was
not clever, indeed, he hardly knew how to read, but
he was a happy believer in Jesus; and he explained
to Mr. Charles that <i>doing</i> was not enough, that we
must believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross for
us, and that it is only through Him that we can
pray to God, and only by His death that we can
hope to go to heaven.</p>

<p>Then a poor woman came in, and she made him
understand better than any one; and at last Mr. Charles
saw where he had been in the wrong, and instead of
trusting in his own goodness and in all the kind
things he had done, he just gave up his faith in these,
and trusted alone in the dying love of his Saviour,
and ours.</p>

<p>I expect all my readers have classes in the schools<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
they go to. Some of you are at the top of your
class, some of you are in the middle, and some of
you are&mdash;well&mdash;near the bottom. I think this is very
much the way in Christ's school, the only difference
is that in your class at school there can only be <i>one</i>
at the top. In Christ's school there can be any
number at the top. There are a great number of
Christians who are only half-way up in the class,
and I am afraid there are a still greater number at
the bottom. That is a place none of us like to be
in at school; then don't let us be content to keep
that place in Christ's school; let us all seek and
obtain top places.</p>

<p>When Mr. John Wesley visited his brother, he
found he had got above him in Christ's school; he
had taken a top place in the class, and John could
not rest until he had got a top place too. So he
prayed very earnestly, and got the people that had
helped his brother to talk to him, but still he did
not seem to understand. Four days after he went to
a little service, and while the preacher was explaining
the change that comes in us, when we trust in Jesus
alone, John Wesley saw it all, took a top place in
Christ's school, and joyfully went and told his
brother.</p>

Germany.&mdash;A walk in Holland.&mdash;Christian David, the German
carpenter.&mdash;The Fellow of Lincoln College takes lessons in a cottage.</p></div>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/cap-i.png" width="100" height="100" alt="I" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /> &nbsp;  DARE say many of my readers go to
Wesleyan Chapels, and understand some
of the Methodist rules. Most of these
rules were made by the two Mr. Wesleys
and their friends more than one hundred and fifty
years ago, and they have been kept by their followers
ever since. I want to tell you about a few of them.</div>

<p>The people who attended the Methodist meetings
were divided into little bands or companies, no band
to have fewer than five persons in it, and none more
than ten. They were to meet every week, and each
one in turn was to tell the rest what troubles and
temptations they had had, and how God, through
Jesus Christ, had helped them since the last meeting.</p>

<p>Every Wednesday evening, at eight o'clock, all the
bands joined together in one large meeting, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
began and ended with hymns and prayer. There
were many other rules, some of which I will tell you
later on, others you can read about when you are
older.</p>

<p>All this time you must remember that Mr. Wesley
was a church clergyman. He loved the Church of
England very dearly, though there were a great many
things in it with which he did not agree.</p>

<p>Wherever he preached he told the people just what
he believed, and as very few clergymen thought as he
did, they did not like him speaking his opinions so
freely. At last, first one and then another said he
should never preach in their churches again. Yet the
message Mr. Wesley gave to the people, was the very
same message that Christ spoke long before on the
shores of Galilee.</p>

<p>Mr. Wesley still longed to understand his Bible
better, and to learn more of Jesus Christ, so he
determined to go and visit the Moravians at a place
called Herrnhuth in Germany, and see if he could get
some help from them. So one June day, he said
good-bye to his mother, and with eight of his friends
set off. One of these friends was an old member of
the Holy Club at Oxford. On their way to
Herrnhuth, they had to pass through Holland. This
is what Mr. Wesley says about a walk they had in
that country:</p>

<p>I never saw such a beautiful road. Walnut trees
grow in rows on each side, so that it is like walking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
in a gentleman's garden. We were surprised to find
that in this country the people at the inns will not
always take in travellers who ask for food and bed.
They refused to receive us at several inns. At one of
the towns we were asked to go and see their church,
and when we went in we took off our hats in
reverence, as we do in England, but the people were
not pleased, they said: "You must not do so, it is
not the custom in this country."</p>

<p>After a long, long journey through Germany, the
little party at last reached Herrnhuth.</p>

<p>Mr. Wesley had only been a few days there, when
he wrote to his brother Samuel: "God has given me
my wish, I am with those who follow Christ in all
things, and who walk as He walked."</p>

<p>I must just tell you about one of these Moravians,
because he helped Mr. Wesley more than any of the
others. His name was Christian David. He was
only an ignorant working-man, and when not
preaching was always to be found working at his
carpenter's bench. But David was Christian in life as
well as in name; he "walked with God," and whether
he preached and prayed, or worked with chisel and
plane, he did all "in the name of the Lord Jesus."
He was never tired of telling people about the Saviour
he loved, and trying to get them to love Him too.
He was a man who often made mistakes, but as some
one has said, "the man who never makes mistakes
never makes anything;" and Christian David was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
always ready to own his faults when they were
pointed out to him.</p>

<p>You remember to what a high position Mr. Wesley
had risen at Oxford, and how clever he was? Yet
Christian David knew more than he did about Jesus
Christ and His love; and the Fellow of Lincoln
College was not too proud to go and sit in a cottage
and be taught by this humble carpenter, who so
closely followed the Holy Carpenter of Nazareth.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 97px;">
<img src="images/cap-w.png" width="97" height="100" alt="W" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />HILE Mr. Wesley was in Germany, his
brother Charles had been preaching and
working in London, and when Mr. John
returned he found about thirty-two people
had joined the society there. They had hired a room
in Fetter Lane, and here they held their meetings.
Mr. Wesley had come back so full of love to Jesus
Christ, and therefore so full of love to everybody,
and so eager for all to be as happy as he was, that
he soon got many others to join them. When he
wrote to his German friends, he said: "We are
trying here, by God's help, to copy you as you copy
Christ."</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>He and his brother still preached in any church
where they were allowed, and wherever they went
crowds of poor people followed to hear them. They
used to go, too, to the prisons, and the hospitals, and
preach to the sinful and the suffering. They told
them how Jesus forgave sins, and how He used to
heal the sick; and the sinful were made sorry, and the
suffering ones were comforted, and many believed in
Jesus and prayed for forgiveness.</p>

<p>Mr. Wesley had returned from Germany in
September; a few months later Mr. George Whitefield
came back from Georgia. He had got on very well
with the people there, because he did not try to alter
the ways they had been accustomed to, unless it was
really necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. Wesley went to meet his old friend, and, oh!
how pleased they were to see each other again.
Mr. Whitefield joined the little society in Fetter
Lane, and they all worked together most happily.</p>

<p>I dare say most of my Methodist readers will have
been to a love-feast; those of you who have not, will
at any rate have heard of them. Well, it was just
about this time that love-feasts were first started.
The little bands or companies that I told you about
used to join together, and have a special prayer
meeting once a month on a Saturday; and the
following day, which, of course, was Sunday, they all
used to meet again between seven o'clock and ten in
the evening for a love-feast&mdash;a meal of bread and water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
eaten altogether and with prayer. It was a custom
of the Moravians, and it was from them Mr. Wesley
copied it.</p>

<p>I have also heard that the love-feast was provided
for the people, who had walked a great many miles to
hear Mr. Wesley preach, and were tired and hungry.
If this was the idea of the love-feast, they would
have to give the people a great deal more bread than
they do now, or they would still be hungry when they
had done.</p>

<p>The year after Mr. Whitefield returned from
Georgia, 1739, was a wonderful year for the
Methodists. It started with a love-feast and prayer
meeting, which lasted half through the night. Then
a few days later, on January 5th, the two Mr. Wesleys
and Mr. Whitefield, with four other ministers, met
together to talk about all they hoped to do during the
year, and make rules and plans for their helpers and
members.</p>

<p>I told you, if you remember, that first one pulpit
and then another was closed against these clergymen.
At last there were only two or three churches where
they were allowed to preach. One day when
Mr. Whitefield was preaching in one of these, the
people came in such crowds to hear him, that
hundreds could not get into the church. Some of
them went away, but a great number stood outside.</p>

<p>All at once there flashed across Mr. Whitefield's
mind this thought: "Jesus preached in the open air<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
to the people, why can't I?" Numbers had often
before been turned away when he preached, but he
had never thought of having a service outside
a church, it seemed a most shocking thing. However,
the message seemed to come straight from God.
He dared not act on it at once, for you see he was
a clergyman, and had always been brought up to
believe that inside the church was the only place
where people can properly worship God.</p>

<p>When he mentioned the matter to his friends, some
of them were very much shocked, and thought to
preach in the open air would be a very wrong thing.
But some said: "We will pray about it, and ask God
to show us what we ought to do." So they knelt
down and prayed to be guided to do the right thing.</p>

<p>Soon after this Mr. Whitefield went to Bristol,
where he had been liked so much before he went to
America. When he got there he was invited to
preach first in one church and then in another, all
were open to him. But before very long the clergymen
in the place showed that they disapproved of
the plain way in which he spoke to the people, and
they told him they would not allow him to preach in
their pulpits again.</p>

<p>By and by all the churches were closed against him,
and there was nowhere but the prison where he was
allowed to preach. Soon the mayor of Bristol closed
that door also.</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Whitefield! what could he do now?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
I think I know one thing he would do. He would
turn to his Bible, and there he would read: "In all
thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy
paths."</p>

<p>In the next chapter you shall hear how God
fulfilled His promise to George Whitefield.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 102px;">
<img src="images/cap-l.png" width="102" height="100" alt="L" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />ONG, long ago, before all this happened
that I have been telling you, there was
a forest near Bristol where the kings of
England used to hunt, Kingswood it
was called. But at the time of which I write, most
of the trees had been cut down; a great many coal
mines had been dug, and the people who lived round
about and worked in the mines were a wild and
wicked lot. They had no churches, and those in
Bristol were three or four miles away.</div>

<p>Surely, Mr. Whitefield thought, these people ought
to have the gospel of Jesus Christ preached to them;
they have no church, it cannot be wrong to preach
to them in the open air. So, one Saturday in this
year, 1739, Mr. Whitefield set off to Kingswood.
It was a cold winter's day, but his heart was warm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
inside with love for these poor neglected colliers, and
he soon got warm outside with his long walk.</p>

<p>When he reached Kingswood he found an open
space called Rose Green, which he thought was just
the place for a service. Standing on a little mound
which did for a pulpit, he commenced to preach;
and surely that was the grandest church in which
a Methodist minister ever held a service. The blue
sky of heaven was his roof, the green grass beneath
him the floor; and as Mr. Whitefield stood in his
FIRST FIELD PULPIT, his thoughts went back, down
the ages, to the dear Master whose steps he was
seeking to follow&mdash;the Preacher of Nazareth, whose
pulpit was the mountain-side, and whose hearers
were the publicans and sinners. Two hundred grimy
colliers stood and listened to that earnest young
preacher.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitefield continued his visits to Kingswood;
the second time, instead of two hundred there were
2,000 eager listeners. The next time over 4,000
came to hear; and so the numbers went on increasing
until he had a congregation of 20,000.</p>

<p>Once, after he had been preaching, he wrote this:
"The trees and the hedges were all in full leaf, and
the sun was shining brightly. All the people were
silent and still, and God helped me to speak in such
a loud voice that everybody could hear me. All in
the surrounding fields were thousands and thousands
of people, some in coaches and some on horseback,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
while many had climbed up into the trees to see
and hear."</p>

<p>As Mr. Whitefield preached, nearly all were in
tears. Many of the men had come straight from
the coal-pits, and the tears that trickled down their
cheeks made little white gutters on their grimy faces.
Then, in the gathering twilight, they sang the closing
hymn, and when the last echoes died away in the
deepening shadows, Mr. Whitefield felt how solemn
it all was, and he, too, could hardly keep back the
tears.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitefield soon found there was more work
at Kingswood than he could do alone, so he wrote
and asked Mr. John Wesley to come and help him.
Being very <i>proper</i> sort of clergymen, John and
Charles Wesley could not help thinking it a dreadful,
and almost a wrong thing to preach anywhere but
in a church, or, at any rate, in a room; and for some
time they could not decide what to do.</p>

<p>They asked the other members at Fetter Lane
what they thought about it; some said Mr. John
ought to go, and some said he ought not. So at
last they decided to draw lots. You know what
that is, don't you? If you look in your Bible, in
Acts i. 26, you will see that the disciples drew lots
when they wanted to make up their number to
twelve, after wicked Judas had killed himself. And
in John xix. 24, you can read how the soldiers cast
lots for the coat that had belonged to Jesus, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
they took away after they had crucified Him. And
in many other places in the Bible we read about
people casting lots.</p>

<p>So the society at Fetter Lane cast lots, and it
came out that Mr. John Wesley should go. Everybody
was satisfied after this, and even Mr. Charles,
who more than any of the others had objected, now
felt that it was right. So Mr. John set off for Bristol
and joined his friend.</p>

<p>The first Sunday he was there he heard Mr.
Whitefield preach in the open air, and this is what
he wrote about it: "It seemed such a strange thing
to preach in the fields, when all my life I had believed
in everything being done properly and according to
the rules of the Church. Indeed, I should have
thought it almost a sin to preach anywhere else."</p>

<p>However, because of the lots, he felt it was all
right; and he was still more sure of this when he
saw the crowds, who would never have gone into a
church, listening so intently to God's Word. He very
soon got used to open-air preaching, and by and by
Mr. Whitefield left the work at Kingswood to him.</p>

<p>When the people heard that Mr. Whitefield was
going to leave them, they were very, very sorry; and
the day he rode out of Bristol, a number of them,
about twenty, rode on horseback with him, they
could not bear to say "good-bye."</p>

<p>As he passed through Kingswood, the poor colliers,
who were so grateful for all he had done for them,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
came out to meet him, and told him they had a great
surprise for him. They had been very busy collecting
money for a school for poor children, and now they
wanted their dear friend, Mr. Whitefield, to lay the
corner-stone of their new building.</p>

<p>He was surprised and delighted; and when the
ceremony was over, he knelt down and prayed that
the school might soon be completed, and that God's
blessing might ever rest upon it; and all those rough
colliers bowed their heads, and uttered a fervent
"Amen."</p>

<p>At last "good-bye" was said to the dear minister
who had brought them the glad tidings of salvation,
and leaving them in charge of Mr. Wesley, George
Whitefield rode away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>John Wesley's moral courage.&mdash;What some carriage people thought
of him.&mdash;And why.&mdash;The fashionable Beau in the big, white hat.&mdash;Interrupts
Mr. Wesley.&mdash;Gets as good as he gives.&mdash;And better.&mdash;The
King of Bath slinks away.</p></div>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 97px;">
<img src="images/cap-d.png" width="97" height="100" alt="D" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />O you know what "moral courage" is, young
readers? How shall I explain it? I think
you will understand it best if I say it is
"courage to do what is right." A boy
may have courage to fight a bigger boy than himself,
but he may not have the moral courage to own to
a fault before his school-fellows, or to side with the
right when that side is unpopular.</div>

<p>Now, I think John Wesley showed a great deal
of moral courage when he started to preach in the
open air. Remember, he was born a gentleman, he
was educated as a gentleman, and as Fellow of an
Oxford College had always mixed with distinguished
gentlemen. Then he was brought up a strict Churchman,
and had always believed that the ways and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
rules of the Church were the only right and proper
ways.</p>

<p>Fancy this most particular Church clergyman,
wearing his gown and bands, just as you have seen
him in the pictures, and getting upon a table in the
open air, or on the stump of a tree, or climbing into
a cart and preaching to a lot of dirty, ignorant men
and women. This was, indeed, moral courage; he
did it because he felt it was the right thing to do,
and that God wanted him to do it.</p>

<p>Mr. Wesley was quite as much liked by the people
as Mr. Whitefield had been, and the sight of him
preaching was such a wonderful one, that ladies and
gentlemen came in their carriages to see and to hear.</p>

<p>In his sermons, Mr. Wesley spoke as plainly to the
rich as he did to the poor. He told them how God
hated sin, and that it was impossible for a sinner to
get to heaven. Some of the ladies and gentlemen did
not like this at all, and called Mr. Wesley "rude and
ill-mannered," but it made them feel uncomfortable
all the same.</p>

<p>You have heard of a place called Bath, and that
it is noted for its mineral waters. It is a fashionable
place now, but it was a great deal more fashionable
in Mr. Wesley's time. Not being far from Bristol,
Mr. Wesley used sometimes to go and preach there.
Once when he went, some of his friends said: "Don't
preach to-day, for Beau Nash means to come and
oppose you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Beau Nash was a gambler, and in other ways, too,
a very bad man. But, somehow, he always managed
to get enough money to make a great show, and many
of the people looked up to him as a leader of fashion.
Indeed, he was quite popular among most of the
visitors to Bath.</p>

<p>Of course when Mr. Wesley heard that this man was
coming to oppose him, instead of being frightened,
he was all the more determined to preach.</p>

<p>A great number of people had assembled, many
of them Nash's friends, who had come to see "the
fun." By and by Beau Nash himself came, looking
very grand in a big white hat, and riding in a coach
drawn by six grey horses, with footmen and coachmen
all complete.</p>

<p>Soon after Mr. Wesley had commenced his sermon,
Beau Nash interrupted him by asking: "Who gave
you leave to do what you are doing?"</p>

<p>"Jesus Christ," said Mr. Wesley, "through the
Archbishop of Canterbury, when he laid his hands
upon my head, and said: 'Take thou authority to
preach the gospel.'"</p>

<p>This answer rather settled Beau Nash. Then he
accused Mr. Wesley of frightening the people out
of their wits.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear me preach?" said Mr. Wesley.</p>

<p>"No," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Then how do you know I frighten people?"</p>

<p>"By what I have heard."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!" said Mr. Wesley. "Then is not your name
Nash?"</p>

<p>"It is," said the Beau.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I suppose, then, I must judge you by
what I have heard of you."</p>

<p>This reply so confounded the young man that he
could not say a word, and when an old woman in
the congregation stood up and told the Beau what
she thought about him, the "King of Bath," as he
was called, slunk away, and took himself off.</p>

<p>This affair made a great stir in Bath, and when
Mr. Wesley went through the town the streets were
full of people, hurrying up and down, wanting to
see him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Good out of evil.&mdash;What Mr. Wesley preached.&mdash;"Hurrah!"&mdash;In
the prison.&mdash;How the wicked Methodists spoiled the woollen trade.&mdash;Emilia
Wesley says strong things.&mdash;In the sunlight.</p></div>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/cap-i.png" width="100" height="100" alt="I" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /> &nbsp;  KNOW you will have thought it very
unkind of the clergymen not allowing
such a good man as Mr. Wesley to
preach in their churches; and so it was,
very unkind, and very wrong. These clergymen
thought so themselves after a time; but God often
uses the wrong doings of people to bring about
a great good, and He did so in this case.</div>

<p>Perhaps if the churches had not been closed against
Mr. Wesley and Mr. Whitefield they would never
have preached in the open air, and thousands of
people, who would not go to a church, might never
have heard the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>You boys and girls love father and mother and
home, do you not? And when you have been away
at day-school or boarding-school, oh! how glad you
always are to get to them again. Well, in the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
way we all come from God; He is our Father, and
heaven is our home, and all of us, deep down inside
of us, have a longing to go home again some day.
But Adam and Eve had to be punished for their
disobedience; and the punishment was that they and
all that were born after them should die, and never go
back to home and to God. This was a terrible
punishment, was it not? But you know how Jesus
Christ, God's Son, in His great love and pity for us
said He would come down from heaven, and be a man
on earth; that He would go through life just as we
have to do, and at last die. Then God said if His
dear Son did this, and lived on earth a life that should
be a beautiful copy for men and women and boys
and girls to follow; and if the people would believe
on Him and follow His example, God would forgive
them, and they should go back to Him, their Father,
and to heaven their home.</p>

<p>All this Mr. Wesley explained to the people, and
told them if they believed this and loved and followed
the Saviour that died for them, they would always be
happy, and God would give them His own peace, the
peace He has promised to those that love Him.</p>

<p>One wonders how the clergymen could disapprove
of such preaching, and why they should shut
Mr. Wesley out of their pulpit, for if they did not
preach this same Gospel they certainly ought to have
done.</p>

<p>However, Mr. Wesley got much larger congregations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
outside the churches than they ever got inside, and
wherever he went hundreds of people believed the
wonderful story he told them, and became true
followers of the Lord Jesus Christ. Strange things
happened at his services; some of the people were so
overjoyed at what they heard they could not help
shouting "Hurrah!" and "Hallelujah!" and they
poked each other in the ribs, as much as to say:
"Isn't that good?"</p>

<p>Then, when Mr. Wesley told them how Jesus Christ
suffered, and how cruelly Judas betrayed Him, and
that He allowed all this in order that we might be
saved, the people would burst into tears, and you
could hear their sobs all over the great congregation.
All sorts of people came to the services, thieves and
gamblers, poor people and rich people, and all heard
the same glad tidings of salvation.</p>

<p>Mr. Wesley did not remain at Bristol; several
times he went up to London, and wherever he went
crowds came to hear him. One day when he was
preaching at Newgate, a prison in London, and was
telling the people what would become of them if they
did not give up their wicked ways, a woman whom
he had known for many years as a very bad character,
burst into tears and begged Mr. Wesley to pray for
her. Many of the other prisoners did the same, and
numbers believed in Jesus Christ as their Saviour,
and became Christian men and we men.</p>

<p>It was just wonderful; but it is sad to think that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
if these people had only heard the Gospel before,
they might never have been the wicked men and
women they were. As soon as ever they heard, they
believed.</p>

<p>All the magazines and newspapers that were
published were full of the doings of the Methodists.
They were still called all sorts of names and abused
dreadfully. But the good people had got so used
to this that they did not mind, indeed, they hardly
expected any other treatment. In those days very
few of the poor people could read, and one newspaper
complained that nearly every one who went to hear
the Methodists wanted to learn to read the Bible, and
as soon as ever he could spell out a chapter he would
go and read it to some one who could not read,
and then they would talk about it together. This,
the paper said, wasted a great deal of time, for the
men were so busy talking and reading their Bibles
that they could not get on with their work, and the
woollen trade in Yorkshire would soon be ruined.
Of course this last was not true, and was only said to
stop the Methodists from preaching. It showed,
however, how sincere and how much in earnest the
people were.</p>

<p>But amidst all the persecutions of mobs of ignorant
and brutal men and women who knew no better, and
of abuse and slander by the rich and the educated,
who ought to have known better, nothing pained
Mr. Wesley so much as the unkind words of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
sister Emilia. She was his favourite sister, and he
thought a great deal about her opinion. In an angry
letter she wrote him, she said the Methodists were
"a lot of bad people."</p>

<p>However, John Wesley and his friends calmly went
on doing the work they felt God had called them
to do. The peace of God was in their hearts, and
the sunlight of His love brightened their faces, and
made them tender and forgiving to all their enemies.
As Jesus Christ prayed for the cruel men who
crucified Him, so they prayed: "Father, forgive them,
for they know not what they do."</p>

<img src="images/cap-i.png" width="100" height="100" alt="I" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /> &nbsp; THINK Mr. Wesley's greatest trouble at
this time was, that even his dear mother,
whom he had not seen for a long, long
time, believed many of the things that
people were saying about him, and felt sure he had
wandered away from the true religion of Jesus Christ.</div>

<p>It does not do for us to believe all we hear, and
when at last Mrs. Wesley went to London, and saw
and talked with her sons, she found all the tales had
been untrue, and that her "dear Jack" was the same
loyal soldier and servant of Jesus Christ that he had
ever been.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>Instead of going back to where she had been living,
Mrs. Wesley, freed from her fears, remained in
London with her "boys," a proud and happy mother.
She joined the Society in Fetter Lane, went every
Sunday to hear her sons preach, and helped them
in every way she could. Once she stood by
Mr. Wesley's side when he preached on Kennington
Common to a congregation of about 20,000 people,
and I don't know which was the prouder, mother
or son.</p>

<p>You remember Mr. Samuel Wesley, the eldest
brother? He was one who strongly disapproved
of open-air preaching, and thought John and Charles
were very much in the wrong for not behaving like
other clergymen. When he heard that even his mother
had joined the Methodists he was more indignant
than ever, and wrote her what I think was a very
rude letter.</p>

<p>"I was very much surprised and grieved," he said,
"when I heard that you had joined the Methodists,
and, indeed, become one of Jack's congregation. My
brothers are brothers to me no longer, and now, must
my mother follow too?"</p>

<p>It is sad to think that two weeks after Mr. Samuel
wrote this he was taken ill and died in a few hours.
He was a clever and a sensible man, but he did not
understand, or even try to understand, the work his
brothers were doing, and, therefore, disapproved of it.</p>

<p>When Mr. Wesley heard the news of his brother's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
death he set off at once to Bristol to Mr. Charles, and
together they went to Tiverton to comfort and help
their sister-in-law. They forgot all the unkind things
their brother had said against them, and only thought
how they could best show their love and sympathy to
those that were left.</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Wesley was very ill when she heard the
sad news. She had always dearly-loved her eldest
child, and his death was a great sorrow. But she
said: "It is God's will, therefore it is all right."</p>

<p>You can tell what a real comfort Mr. John was
to her at this time, by the letter she wrote to Charles
at Bristol about a month after Mr. Samuel's death.
This is what she said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Charles</span>,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You cannot want to see me more than I want to see
you. Your brother Jack, whom I shall call son Wesley,
now that my dear Sam is gone home, has just been in to see
me, and has cheered me up ever so much. Indeed, he
never comes but he does me good; his visits are all too
seldom and too short. For this I cannot blame him, for
I know he is about his Heavenly Father's business.</p>

<p>"But, dear Charles, I do so want one of you, for I feel
weak as a little child. I do pray that God will bless you
both in your work, and keep you from harm; and that He
will give you strength and courage to preach the true Gospel
of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>"This is the hearty prayer of, dear Charles,</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">"Your loving mother,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Susanna Wesley</span>."<br />
</div></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Is not that a loving letter? No wonder Mr. Charles
prized it very much. Little folks generally take care
of all the letters they get. I know I did when I was
a little girl, indeed I have some of them now.
Grown-up people usually tear theirs up, they get so
many. But this letter that Mr. Charles had from his
dear old mother was too precious to be so treated;
he took great care of it, and after his death it was
found among his papers.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A very old school.&mdash;The first Methodist Chapel.&mdash;Well done,

</div><div class='unindent'><br />OU remember the school at Kingswood,
that the colliers collected the money for
and started? Although it is one hundred
and fifty years ago since it was opened,
there has been a school at Kingswood ever since, and
it is the very oldest thing we have in connection with
Methodism.</div>

<p>If you will listen at chapel some time&mdash;in October
I think it generally is&mdash;you will hear the minister
say: "Collections will be taken to-day, morning and
evening, on behalf of the Kingswood Schools." When
you hear this will you just think, that the money you
give is for the same school that was started by those
good-hearted colliers near Bristol, more than one
hundred and fifty years ago.</p>

<p>Now I must tell you of the very first Methodist<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Chapel that was ever built; for this, too, we have to
thank the Bristol people. Having heard about Jesus
Christ themselves, they were eager for their friends
and neighbours to hear about Him too. They worked
very hard, and were so much in earnest inviting
people to come to the services, that at last the room
where they held their meeting got far too small for
all the people who wanted to come. It was only
a tumble-down sort of place, and they were afraid the
floor might give way or the roof fall in, and somebody
be hurt.</p>

<p>At last they secured a piece of ground in what was
called the Horse Fair in Bristol, and one bright May
morning, in 1739, the first stone of the</p>

<div class='center'>
FIRST METHODIST CHAPEL<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>was laid, amidst great shouting of praise and
thanksgiving. I have called it a Chapel, but the
Methodists called it a "Preaching House."</div>

<p>You may think what a great deal of money it took
to carry on all the work that the Methodists were
doing; sometimes their purses were very empty, and
they wondered however they should get them filled
again. But it was God's work they were doing, and
of course the money always came.</p>

<p>Like most Methodist Chapels nowadays, the
money to pay for the Bristol Preaching House was
not got all at once; but a plan was adopted which,
I think, was a very good one. Every Methodist in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Bristol promised to pay a penny a week until all
the money was raised; and as there were some
hundreds of Methodists, the debt was soon paid off.
Some of the people, however, were too poor to pay
even this small amount, so it was arranged that the
richer men should each call upon eleven poorer ones
every week, and collect their pennies, and when they
could not give them, the rich man was to make it up.
This was the beginning of the weekly class money
which your fathers and mothers, if they are Methodists,
pay in their class-meetings to-day.</p>

<p>When Mr. Wesley told the society in Fetter Lane,
London, of the good plan the Bristol people had
made, they adopted it too, and always after that
wherever the Methodists commenced a society, the
penny-a-week rule was followed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>An explosion.&mdash;A new business at the old Foundry.&mdash;Mr. Wesley

<img src="images/cap-h.png" width="100" height="100" alt="H" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />OW old would John Wesley be in 1716, if
he was born in 1703? Thirteen, would
he not? a school-boy at the Charterhouse
School. In that year there was a terrible
explosion at a cannon foundry, where the guns were
made for war. The roof of the building was blown
off, and a great many workmen were injured and killed.</div>

<p>After this explosion, the machinery and iron were
removed to Woolwich, which, as you will learn in
your geography is still the great place for making
cannon and other weapons of war. All the years
from 1716 to 1739 the old foundry had never been
touched, there it was, still in ruins.</p>

<p>One day in this year, 1739, while Mr. Wesley was
in London, two gentlemen came and asked him if he
would preach in this old tumble-down place. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
consented, and one dreary November morning at
eight o'clock, before the grey clouds of night had fled,
he preached to about six thousand people in the old
King's Foundry.</p>

<p>The following week many of those who had
listened to him, came and begged him to buy the old
place for a meeting-house. After thinking and
praying about the matter he consented, and before
very long the roof was mended, galleries were made,
and the first Methodist preaching-place in London
was ready for use.</p>

<p>Class-rooms and a school-room were afterwards
built, and a house fitted up where Mr. Wesley and
his mother could live. At the end of the chapel
was another house for his servants and some of
his helpers. There was also a coach-house and stable
where the travelling preachers could "put up."</p>

<p>Though Mr. John and Mr. Charles Wesley were so
clever and worked so hard, they could never have got
on without their earnest, loving helpers. There was
Thomas Maxfield, one of those devoted, go-a-head
men of Bristol; then there was John Nelson, a stone-mason,
in Yorkshire, who, when his master wanted
him to work on Sunday, refused; and, like other
Methodists, having become a Christian himself he
sought to win others for Christ.</p>

<p>Thomas Olivers was another. Poor Thomas, when
he was a wee boy, only four years old, both his
father and his mother died, and little Tom was left to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
grow up a wicked boy. He used to swear and
gamble and drink, and when he became a man was
one of the worst characters in Bristol. But he heard
Mr. Whitefield preach, and from that time a change
came over him. He felt he was too great a sinner
ever to be forgiven, and would kneel down and pray
for hours and hours. God saw how sorry he was for
all his wickedness, and how much he longed to be
different, so He just whispered His forgiveness,
bidding him, "Go and sin no more," and Thomas
Olivers rose up a converted man, and became as
brave a Christian as he had been bold a sinner.</p>

<p>"Yon. Him with the long hair, and

<p>"I dunno. Why there's two on 'em."</p>

<p>"I say, Polly, let's go and hear 'em, they're singing.
Come on, Bob."</p>

<p>Bob and Billy and Polly were very ragged and
very dirty children, and they lived in Newcastle.</p>

<p>The boys were almost naked, and Polly, though
nearly fifteen had no clothes on at all, only a dirty
bit of blanket wrapped round her. Their fathers and
mothers worked in the coal mines, and because they
had never been taught different, they were drunken,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
swearing, wicked people; even the children cursed
and swore.</p>

<p>But Bob and Billy and Polly have got to the top
of Sandgate, the street where their miserable home
is; let us follow. Some of their companions are
with them, children as ragged and dirty as themselves.
The women, too, have come to their doors to listen.
What is it these men are singing? Hark!</p>

</div>

<p>It was a lovely May morning, and a kind little sunbeam
had left the green fields and the chirping
birdlets to peep into Sandgate. I think it must have
heard the singing, and wanted to shine its gladness,
that God's praises were at last being sung to those
poor people.</p>

<p>It was quite early, about seven o'clock in the
morning, and some of the men and women were
still in bed; but little sunbeam went first to one
and then to another and kissed them awake, and
when they had rubbed their eyes and opened their
ears, they heard a strange sound. What could
it be? They had never heard anything like it
before.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 343px;">
<img src="images/i-111.png" width="343" height="500" alt="&quot;If you come to yon hill at five o&#39;clock to-night, I&#39;ll tell you what I mean.&quot;&mdash;Page 95." title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;If you come to yon hill at five o&#39;clock to-night, I&#39;ll tell you what I mean.&quot;&mdash;<a href="#Page_95">Page 95</a>.</span>
</div>

<p>They sat up in bed and listened, then they got
dressed, and then they went out. The music acted
like a magic spell, and drew them to it. One man,
two men, three men, four men, five men; oh, dear!
there are too many to count. Such a number of
women too, why, there must be five hundred people
all together, and still they keep coming. One of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
gentlemen is now talking. Listen what he is saying!
He is preaching a sermon, and this is his text: "<i>He
was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised
for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was
upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed.</i>" He is
telling those poor men and women that it was Jesus,
the Son of God, who suffered this for them, <i>because
He loved them</i>.</p>

<p>The people, who numbered about twelve hundred,
stood gaping and staring, they had never heard anything
like this before.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" shouted one man.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" called out another.</p>

<p>The gentleman with the long hair and beautiful
face answered them: "If you want to know who
I am, my name is John Wesley, and if you come to
yon hill at five o'clock to-night, I'll tell you what
I mean."</p>

<p>At five o'clock the hill was covered with people
from the top to the bottom, and as Mr. Wesley stood
with that great crowd round him, all eager to learn
about the wonderful Saviour who had died for them,
and of whom they had never heard, tears of pity
filled his eyes, and a big love for them filled his
heart.</p>

<p>Oh, so sweetly and tenderly did he read to them
God's own words: "<i>I will heal their back-sliding,
I will love them freely;</i>" and then he told them the
"Old, Old Story."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>He told it very slowly:</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"'That they might take it in,</span><br />
That wonderful redemption,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">God's remedy for sin.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>He told them the story simply:</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'As to a little child,</span><br />
For they were weak and weary,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And helpless and defi'ed.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>He told them the story softly:</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'With earnest tones and grave,</span><br />
For were they not the sinners<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whom Jesus came to save?'"</span><br />
<br /><br /></div>



<p>When the preacher finished, the people stood as if
spell-bound, then they all crowded and pressed round
him, full of love and kindness towards the man who
had brought them such good news. They nearly
trampled him down in their eagerness to speak to
him, and he had to slip round a back way in order to
escape. When he got to the inn where he was
staying, he found some of the people had got there
before him; they had come to beg and pray him to
stay among them. No, he could not.</p>

<p>"Stay a few days," said one. No, he could not do
that.</p>

<p>"Just one day more," they begged.</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Wesley was very loth to leave these
eager hearers, but he had promised to be in Bristol
on the Tuesday, and this was Sunday night, and it
would take him all the time to get to his appointment,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
and he was a man that could not break his word. So
he was sadly obliged to refuse.</p>

<p>Before very long, however, Mr. Charles Wesley
went to Newcastle, and after a time, Mr. Wesley himself
paid a second visit.</p>

<p>It was a plan of the Methodists always to go to the
poorest and most uncared-for people. These they
generally found among the colliers. Wherever there
were coal mines, the district round them was sure to
be the abode of dirt, ignorance, and sin. You
remember what a dreadful place Kingswood was
when the Methodists first went? Because they
found Newcastle just as bad, they called it "The
Kingswood of the North."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A magic mirror.&mdash;And the picture it shows us.&mdash;Billy and Polly

heads together.&mdash;The result.&mdash;Strict Rules.&mdash;Circuits in Methodism.</p></div>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/cap-h.png" width="100" height="100" alt="H" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />AVE you ever heard of the Magic Mirror?
It is a mirror I would like to have. You
just think of something you would very
much like to see; something either in the
past, the present, or the future, peep into the mirror
and there it is.</div>

<p>Let us imagine that we have this mirror, and that
we want to look at a particular part of Newcastle
in the year 1742.</p>

<p>What do we see?</p>

<p>A big unfinished building with all the walls standing,
but no roof, no doors, and no windows. It is a cold
winter's day; but in spite of the biting wind and the
frosty air there are hundreds of people crowding
inside and outside the walls. Right in the middle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
stands the gentleman with the long hair and the
beautiful face.</p>

<p>It is Mr. Wesley opening the first meeting-house in
Newcastle. Oh, how hard those poor colliers and
their wives, yes, and the children too, worked to get
money to build their chapel. On this opening day
they were so proud and happy they could not keep
still. They kept shouting "Hallelujah!" all the time
Mr. Wesley was preaching. Three or four times he
had to stop in the middle of his sermon on purpose
to let them praise God.</p>

<p>Bob, and Billy, and Polly were at that opening;
they loved Mr. Wesley, and always tried to get as
near to him as they could. They were not ragged
now, for their fathers and mothers were converted,
and their money was no longer spent in drink. The
children, too, had learnt to love Jesus, and were trying
to be like Him, and no cursing or swearing was ever
heard.</p>

<p>Scores of men and women in Newcastle that day,
thanked God they had got out of bed that Sunday
morning in May, and heard Mr. Wesley sing at the
top of Sandgate.</p>

<p>The Methodists had now chapels or meeting-houses
in Bristol, London, Kingswood, and Newcastle, and
societies were being formed in a great many other
places. When Mr. Wesley found the work was
spreading so fast, he saw it was necessary to draw up
some general rules for all the members to follow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>His brother Charles helped him in this difficult
task. These are some of the rules which together
they drew up, and which all who joined the Methodists
had to promise to obey.</p>

<p>Members of society must not swear.</p>

<p>Must keep the Sabbath Day holy.</p>

<p>Must not buy or sell intoxicating liquor.</p>

<p>Must not drink intoxicating liquor, except as
medicine.</p>

<p>Must not fight.</p>

<p>Must not quarrel.</p>

<p>Must return good for evil.</p>

<p>Must not speak evil of any one.</p>

<p>Must do to others as we would have them do to us.</p>

<p>Must not wear a great deal of jewellery or expensive
clothes.</p>

<p>Must not go to any place of amusement where they
would not like to meet Jesus.</p>

<p>Must not sing songs or read books that will not
help them to love God more.</p>

<p>Must not buy anything unless they are quite sure
they will be able to pay for it.</p>

<p>Must be kind to everybody, and give help to all, as
far as they are able;</p>

<div class='blockquot2'>
By feeding the hungry;<br />
Clothing the naked;<br />
Visiting the sick and those in prison;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>By "running with patience the race that is set before them;"<br />
By denying themselves and taking up their cross daily.<br />
</div>

<p>They must go to chapel regularly.</p>

<p>Must take the Sacrament.</p>

<p>And, lastly, have family and private prayer every
day.</p>

<p>Were not these strict rules? But the people were
so much in earnest, and had such trust in their leader,
Mr. Wesley, that they were quite willing to agree
to them.</p>

<p>The next thing Mr. Wesley did was to send out his
helpers, generally two together, to certain districts
where they usually remained for a year. They had
to preach in all the places round about, and each
particular district or tract of country was called
a "circuit." This was the beginning of the "circuits"
which we have in Methodism to-day. I dare say you
have often heard father or mother say, "Oh, Mr.
So and So has gone to another circuit;" or, "Mr.
So and So is in our circuit now."</p>

<p>London and Bristol always remained the chief
circuits; but before very long Newcastle became the
next in importance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Another peep into the Magic Mirror.&mdash;A pretty picture.&mdash;At
Epworth.&mdash;Mr. Wesley is very unkindly treated.&mdash;All for the best.&mdash;The
curate is "done."&mdash;A happy ending to a bad beginning.&mdash;"Good-bye,

<div class="figleft" style="width: 98px;">
<img src="images/cap-s.png" width="98" height="100" alt="S" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />HALL we have another peep into the
Magic Mirror? See that pretty country
church, with the square tower. There
are some big trees near, looking as if they
were tall giants keeping guard; they have no leaves
on them yet, and their bare arms stretch out a long
way as if they were trying to reach the church.</div>

<p>If you look carefully you will see buds coming out
on the trees, baby buds they are, waiting for the sun's
kisses. Then they will burst out and grow into great
leaves that will cover up the naked old trees. Ivy
climbs up the church wall. I see its dark glossy
leaves, for the ivy is evergreen.</p>

<p>There are many graves in the churchyard, but you
can hardly see them because people are sitting on
them; such a number of people, hundreds more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
could ever have got into the church. They are all
looking one way, and seem to be listening very
attentively. What are they looking at? They are
looking at a gentleman who is standing all alone on
a big flat tombstone near the church wall. He wears
a gown and white bands like a clergyman, and he has
long hair brushed very smoothly, and a beautiful,
happy face.</p>

<p>Dear me! did I hear a crash then? And did
I hear a hundred young voices shouting: "I know
who it is, it's Mr. John Wesley"? Why, you must
have broken the mirror with your shouts. You are
right, dears, but you shouted rather too soon. I wanted
to read what it said on the tombstone on which
Mr. Wesley was standing. But, never mind, I think
I saw some of the words:</p>

<div class='center'>
"<span class="smcap">Sacred To the Memory of</span><br />
SAMUEL WESLEY,<br />
<span class="smcap">For Thirty-eight years Rector of Epworth</span>."<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Yes, it was his father's grave on which John Wesley
was standing.</div>

<p>On his way back from one of his visits to Newcastle
he thought he would like to see his dear old home
once more. It was a long, long time since he had
been there, and he was not quite sure whether the
people would have anything to do with him now, for,
as leader of the Methodists, he had many enemies.</p>

<p>It was Saturday evening in early spring, when he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
got to the little inn, in the long straggling street that
was called Epworth village. He had not been there
very long before three or four poor women found him
out, one of them an old servant of his mother's.</p>

<p>Next morning, which was Sunday, he went to the
curate of the church and politely offered to help him
with the service. The curate, I am sorry to say, was
very rude, and refused to let Mr. Wesley take any
part in the service or to preach in the church at all.</p>

<p>This was a great disappointment, for Mr. Wesley
loved the people of Epworth, and every stone in
the old church was dear to him. His father had
preached from that pulpit for nearly forty years, and
he himself had stood there more times than he could
count, and it was very hard that he was forbidden to
take his place there now.</p>

<p>The people were longing to hear him, and when
the afternoon service was over, and all the folks were
leaving the church, one of his friends stood in the
churchyard and gave out this notice:</p>

<div class='center'>
"<span class="smcap">Mr. Wesley, not being allowed to Preach</span><br />
<span class="smcap">in the Church, intends to Preach here at</span><br />
<span class="smcap">six o'clock this evening.</span>"<br />
</div>

<p>It was this picture of Mr. Wesley preaching that
the Magic Mirror showed us. I expect the curate
was very angry at being so "done;" but he could
not stop Mr. Wesley preaching <i>outside</i> the church.</p>

<p>For a whole week John Wesley preached every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
evening from his father's tombstone. Crowds came
to hear him, and hundreds were converted and turned
from their evil ways. They saw how sinful they had
been and prayed aloud for forgiveness. Drunkards
became sober men, and those who cursed and swore
were turned into peace-makers.</p>

<p>So dear old Mr. Wesley's prayers were answered,
and the people who had treated him so unkindly, and
whom he had forgiven and loved, now took his
Saviour to be their Saviour, and his God to be their
God.</p>

<p>Indeed Mr. Wesley's visit to his old home, that
began so unpleasantly, ended very happily, and when
his last evening came, both he and his dear people
found it hard to say "Good-bye."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 101px;">
<img src="images/cap-a.png" width="101" height="100" alt="A" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /> &nbsp; GOOD mother is a boy's or a girl's best
earthly friend. John Wesley knew this,
and thought there was no mother like
<i>his</i> mother. You remember how, as a
little boy, he always went to her for advice; and
when he was quite a young man he used to hope
that he would die before her, for he felt he could
not live without his mother. You may think, then,
how sad he was when, at last, the message came to
him that she was dying.</div>

<p>He was at Bristol when he received the news, and
at once set off for London. Arrived at his home
at the Foundry, he found his five sisters watching
round the bed of the dear old mother.</p>

<p>Though she was too ill to speak to them, they
could see she was quite happy and peaceful, just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
waiting to be taken Home. Before long the call
came: "Come up higher."</p>

<p>A great number of people came to the funeral;
and as Mr. Wesley stood at the graveside, he preached
one of his most wonderful sermons. His heart was
full; he had lost the friend of his life. But he knew
it was not for ever, one day he would meet her again;
and as he looked on those hundreds of people gathered
there by the open grave, he longed that they should,
as surely, some day pass Home through the Beautiful
Gate.</p>

<p>Work is the best cure for sorrow; and after his
dear mother's death, Mr. Wesley began his preaching
again. Wherever he went people were converted, and
became followers of Jesus Christ; and also wherever
he went wicked men and women tried to stop him
preaching, and sometimes even wanted to kill him.
But he was doing God's work, and God took care
of him.</p>

<p>Once he was preaching to hundreds of people in
an open space somewhere in London. In the middle
of his sermon, several men tried to drive a herd of
cows among the listeners. They wanted to frighten
them, and force them to go away. But the cows
were wiser than their masters, and would not go
among the people. Then these bad men started
throwing stones, and one of them hit Mr. Wesley
just between his eyes. What do you think he did?
Give up preaching and go home? Indeed he did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
not; he just wiped the blood off his face, and went
on telling the people to repent of their sins and
believe on the Son of God. Brave John Wesley!</p>

<p>Bristol, you remember, was the first place where
Mr. Wesley preached out of doors, and it was at
Bristol where there was the first great disturbance.</p>

<p>I don't quite know how it was, but just about this
time, wherever the Methodists went, they were abused
and ill-treated. I think Satan was beginning to find
out how much good the Methodists were doing, and
thought it was about time he did something to stop
it. So, in all the towns where the preachers went,
he stirred up the worst men and women to make
rows and disturb the services.</p>

<p>At Chelsea, the rioters threw fireworks into the
room; at another place they broke in the roof, and
some of the people were nearly killed. At Bristol,
the mob filled the streets, shouting, and cursing, and
swearing. When the constables caught the ring-leaders
and took them before the mayor, they began
to speak against Mr. Wesley, but the mayor stopped
them. "Whatever Mr. Wesley is, is nothing to
you," he said. "I won't allow any rioting in this
city, and you must go to prison." This was the
first and last disturbance at Bristol. But the worst
of it was, at most of the places, neither the constables
nor the mayor would interfere, and so the people did
just as they liked.</p>

<p>At Wednesbury, in Staffordshire, the Methodists<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
were most cruelly treated. One of the rioters used
to blow a horn, and then all the mob gathered
together. They went to every house where there
was a Methodist, smashed the windows, dragged the
furniture out and broke it up, and burnt the beds.
If the men or women interfered, they just knocked
them down; even the little children they used to
beat. But I think I will leave the exciting scenes
at Wednesbury for another chapter.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 97px;">
<img src="images/cap-w.png" width="97" height="100" alt="W" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />HEN Mr. Wesley heard how his followers
were being treated in Wednesbury, he
went off at once to their help. Though
he was only a little man, he was as brave
as a lion; he knew he had God at his back, and
like David before Goliath, like Daniel before Darius,
and like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego before
Nebuchadnezzar, he did not fear what man could
do unto him.</div>

<p>God sent His angel to close the lions' mouths so
they would not harm Daniel; and the same messenger
walked in the fiery furnace with the three Hebrew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
youths. So, when Mr. Wesley went straight into
the market-place in Wednesbury, and fearlessly
preached to the hundreds assembled there, God's
protecting angel breathed silence and calm; not
a sound of disturbance was heard. In the evening
the mob surrounded the house where Mr. Wesley
was staying, shouting out fiercely:</p>

<p>"Bring out the minister! We will have the
minister!"</p>

<p>Mr. Wesley, neither frightened nor excited, quietly
asked one of his friends to bring in the ringleader
of the mob. The man came in, anger and fierceness
in his eyes. But, somehow, as soon as he stood in
the presence of that calm, Christ-like man, all his
passion went out of him. Mr. Wesley then asked
him to bring in two or three of his roughest
companions. The angry men came in. They had
wanted to get at the minister, now they had the
chance. But once inside that room, they found they
could not touch him. They felt the presence of
God's protecting angel, and peace took the place
of passion, and friendliness the place of hatred.
Getting Mr. Wesley between them, these strange,
new friends made a way for him through the mob
outside the house.</p>

<p>Then, standing on a chair, Mr. Wesley spoke to
the crowd.</p>

<p>"You wanted me," he said. "Here I am. Now
what do you want me for?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"We want you to go with us to the magistrate,"
they cried.</p>

<p>"I will go with you with all my heart," he
replied.</p>

<p>So away went the brave ambassador for Christ,
accompanied by hundreds of the roughest men and
women in Wednesbury.</p>

<p>It was two miles to the magistrate's house, and
before they had got half-way the night came on,
and it began to rain very heavily. This made
most of the people turn back and hurry home,
but two hundred or more kept together round
Mr. Wesley.</p>

<p>Some of the men ran on first to tell the magistrate
they'd got the Methodist preacher. Instead of
seeming pleased, the magistrate said:</p>

<p>"What have I to do with Mr. Wesley? Take
him back again." So he sent them off, and went
to bed.</p>

<p>By and by the crowd came up to the house, and
knocked at the door. When the magistrate's son
went to them and asked what was the matter, they
said:</p>

<p>"Why, please, sir, these Methodists sing psalms all
day, and make folks get up at five o'clock in the
morning, and what would your worship advise us
to do?"</p>

<p>"To go home and be quiet," replied the gentleman.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Finding they could get no help from this
magistrate, they hurried poor Mr. Wesley off to
another. This gentleman, too, had gone to bed,
and so the mob could do nothing else but go
home.</p>

<p>However, before they had got very far they were
joined by another rough mob from a neighbouring
town; and then, in the rain and the darkness, the
two mobs started fighting and knocking each other
down. It was no use Mr. Wesley trying to speak,
for the shouting and noise was like the roaring of
the sea. They dragged him along with them until
they reached the town, and then, seeing the door
of a large house open, Mr. Wesley tried to get in.
But one of the cruel men got him by the hair and
pulled him back into the middle of the mob; and
then they dragged him from one end of the town
to the other.</p>

<p>"I talked all the time to those that were within
hearing," said Mr. Wesley, afterwards, "and I never
felt the least pain or weariness."</p>

<p>At last he saw a shop door half open, and tried
to get in, but the gentleman to whom the shop
belonged would not let him.</p>

<p>"Why, the people would pull my house down,"
he said, "if I let you in."</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 334px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;Knock him down! Kill him at once!&#39; cried hundreds of voices.&quot;&mdash;<a href="#Page_114">Page 114</a>.</span>
</div>
<p>However, Mr. Wesley stood at the door and
shouted to the people: "Are you willing to hear
me speak?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no; knock him down! Kill him at once!"
cried hundreds of voices.</p>

<p>"Nay, let's hear him first," shouted others.</p>

<p>"What harm have I done any of you?" exclaimed
the fearless preacher. "Which of you have I wronged
in word or deed?"</p>

<p>For a quarter of an hour he talked to them, then
his voice suddenly gave way, the strain had been
too great.</p>

<p>Then the cruel mob cried out again: "Bring him
away! Bring him away!"</p>

<p>But Mr. Wesley's strength had come back, and he
began to pray aloud.</p>

<p>That prayer acted like magic; the man who had
just before been the leader of that brutal crowd,
turning to Mr. Wesley, said: "Sir, I will spend my
life for you; follow me, and no one here shall touch
a hair of your head."</p>

<p>Two or three of his companions said almost the
same, and surrounded Mr. Wesley to protect him.
Then four or five rough men set upon them, and
tried to drag Mr. Wesley away; but a butcher, who
was a little further off, shouted, "Shame! shame!"
and pulled them back one after another. Some one
else shouted, "For shame! For shame! let the good
man go!"</p>

<p>Then, just as if they had been struck by magic, all
the people drew back right and left, and Mr. Wesley
was carried safely through.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>But the danger was not quite over even yet.
On the bridge which they had to cross, the mob
assembled again; but Mr. Wesley's protectors took
him across a mill-dam and then through some fields,
and at last brought him safe into Wednesbury, with
no other damage than a torn coat and a little skin
scraped off one of his hands.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mr. Wesley's story of the Wednesbury riot.&mdash;How he felt.&mdash;The
right pocket.&mdash;Beautiful hair.&mdash;The prize-fighter a good protector.&mdash;A
brick, a stone, and two hard blows.&mdash;Daniel vi. 22.</p></div>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 101px;">
<img src="images/cap-a.png" width="101" height="100" alt="A" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />FTER reading the last exciting chapter,
you will all exclaim, "Well, Mr. Wesley
<i>was</i> a brave man!" and I am sure you
will like to hear what he himself said
about his adventures. These are the very words he
wrote after the Wednesbury riots:</div>

<p>"From the beginning to the end, I felt as calm as if
I had been sitting in my study at home. Once it did
come into my mind, that if they threw me into the
river, it would spoil the papers I had in my pocket.
I was not afraid for myself, for I did not doubt but
I could swim across to the opposite bank.</p>

<p>"Thinking about it all now, I notice some remarkable
circumstances. One was, that though several
tried to get hold of me, it seemed as if they could
not, and when at last one did get hold of my coat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and tore the pocket off, it was the right pocket for
him to get, for it contained nothing of importance;
whereas if he had torn off the other he would have
got a bank-note with it.</p>

<p>"Another was, a big strong fellow just behind
struck at me several times with a large oak stick.
One blow had it hit me would have killed me, but
somehow every time he struck, the blow was turned
aside. I don't know how, for I could not move either
to the right hand or to the left.</p>

<p>"Another man came rushing through the crowd
and raised his arm to strike me. Suddenly he let his
arm drop, and only stroked my hair, saying: 'What
beautiful hair he has!'</p>

<p>"It was strange too, that the very first men whose
hearts were softened were always the leaders of the
mob&mdash;one of them had been a prize-fighter. So that
when they took my part I was well protected.</p>

<p>"Again, from first to last I heard no one give me
a reviling word, or call me by any insolent or
disgraceful name whatever. The cry of one and all
was: 'The Preacher! The Preacher! The Parson!
The Minister!'"</p>

<p>Again Mr. Wesley wrote:</p>

<p>"By what gentle and gradual steps does God
prepare us for His will! Two years ago a brick that
was thrown at me grazed my shoulders. Then a year
after that, the stone struck me between the eyes when
I was preaching in London. This evening I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
received two blows; one man struck me on the chest
with all his might, and another on the mouth with
such force that the blood gushed out immediately.
But both were as nothing, I felt no more pain from
either of the blows, than if the men had touched me
with a straw."</p>

<p>Boys and girls, is not this a wonderful story? Get
your Bibles, and look in the sixth chapter of the book
of Daniel and the twenty-second verse.</p>

<p>Wicked men had laid a trap for King Darius, and
because they were envious of Daniel, they caused the
king to order Daniel to be thrown into the lions' den.
This made King Darius very unhappy, for he loved
Daniel. But though he was a heathen king, he had
such faith in Daniel's God, that he felt sure the lions
would not be allowed to hurt him.</p>

<p>King Darius could not sleep all night, for thinking
of Daniel all alone in the den of those wild beasts;
so he got up very early in the morning, and went to
the den and called to Daniel to know if he were alive.
And from inside that dismal den with hungry beasts
prowling round and round, came the bright, cheering
voice of the God-protected man: "My God hath sent
His angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they
have not hurt me."</p>

<p>John Wesley was as much among wild beasts at
Wednesbury, as ever Daniel was in the den of lions,
for when men's passions are roused they are no better
than the beasts. But the arm that was raised to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
strike, gently stroked his hair; the blow that was
meant to kill, fell upon an invisible head; the leaders
of all that was cruel and wicked, were struck tender
and quiet, and became personal protectors.</p>

<p>Truly Mr. Wesley could have said with Daniel:
"My God hath sent His angel, and hath shut the
lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me."</p>

Munchin thought of John Wesley.&mdash;Hymn 276 and
how it came to be written.&mdash;The mischievous schoolboy becomes the

<div class="figleft" style="width: 102px;">
<img src="images/cap-t.png" width="102" height="100" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />HE troubles in Wednesbury were not yet
ended. The very magistrates who had
refused to see Mr. Wesley that night
when the mob dragged him to the door,
a few days later gave orders for the police to search
everywhere for "those Methodist preachers who go
about raising riots."</div>

<p>Even this failed to frighten the brave-hearted
Wesleys, for when John left Wednesbury his brother
Charles took his place. He found the poor Methodists
still suffering terrible persecutions, but patient and
forgiving to their enemies. Christ's own words were
their help and comfort: "<i>Blessed are they that are
persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the
kingdom of heaven</i>" (Matt. v. 10).</p>

<p>Munchin, the man who had been one of the leaders<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
of the mob and afterwards protected Mr. Wesley, had
joined the Methodists and become a member of
society. One day Mr. Charles said to him: "What
did you think of my brother?"</p>

<p>"Think of him?" said Munchin; "I think he is
a man of God; and God was surely by his side when
so many of us could not kill one man."</p>

<p>The persecutions of the Methodists in Wednesbury
continued for a long time. The windows of their
houses were broken, their tables, chairs, and other
furniture were smashed to pieces, and their feather-beds
were torn into shreds. No craven-hearted man would
have dared to go into such a place of danger, and
preach to such fiends in human form; but the Wesleys
knew no fear when duty called, and again and again
they visited their poor, persecuted followers. Christ-like
men, indeed, they were, for, like their Holy
Leader, "when they were reviled they reviled not
again; when they suffered they threatened not."</p>

<p>Mr. Charles composed a hymn after one of the
dreadful rows, which shows how entirely they trusted
in Jesus, and how sure they were that no harm could
come to them except what He allowed.</p>

<p>Look at number 276 in your Wesley's Hymn-Book,
and you will find this very hymn. This is
the first verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Worship and thanks and blessing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And strength ascribe to Jesus!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Jesus alone defends His own,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">When earth and hell oppress us.</span><br />
<br />
"Jesus with joy we witness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Almighty to deliver,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Our seals set to, that God is true,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And reigns a King for ever."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>That reminds me that I must not forget to tell you,
by far the greater number of the hymns we sing every
Sunday in chapel were written by Mr. Charles Wesley.
Yes, the little mischievous Westminster schoolboy
became the sweet singer of Methodism. Not only
among Methodists are his beautiful hymns sung
to-day, but in almost every Christian hymn-book
in the world some of his verses will be found.</div>

<p>You must not think all places were like Wednesbury.
Mr. Wesley had often very attentive congregations,
and the people listened to him gladly. Indeed, at
an open-air service he once held, the people behaved
better than I fear we should have done. Part of the
congregation sat on a low wall built of loose stones;
all at once, in the middle of the sermon, down came
the wall and all the people with it. I think we should
have burst out laughing, it must have looked so funny.
Instead of which, there was no laughing and no
screaming; the people just kept their places, only
instead of sitting on the top of the wall they sat
at the bottom. There was no interruption of the
service at all; Mr. Wesley went on with his sermon,
and the people continued reverent and attentive.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Magic Mirror again.&mdash;Sycamore Farm.&mdash;Annie's good news.&mdash;A
chorister up in a tree.&mdash;A long, long journey.&mdash;Sixty miles a day
on horseback.&mdash;A Chapel out of doors.&mdash;A hard bed and a funny

<div class="figleft" style="width: 97px;">
<img src="images/cap-w.png" width="97" height="100" alt="W" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />HY, I do believe that Magic Mirror has
mended itself, for here it is, showing us
such a lovely picture&mdash;nay, two, I declare.
Look at that dear old farmhouse; it must
surely be called Sycamore Farm, for there are great
sycamore trees all round the front and the side.
At the back, and only one field away from the house,
are the green slopes of the mountain, with a little
waterfall tumbling merrily down a crack in its side.
In front of the farm, shimmering through the leaves
of the trees, you can see the sunlit waters of a calm
lake. The farm is a low whitewashed building, and
we can see the cows in the distant meadows coming
home to be milked. No one is with them; but there
is a little group of people standing at the farmyard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
gate. The farmer and his wife and all the family
and servants seem to be there.</div>

<p>Whatever is the matter?</p>

<p>Oh, see! there is a little girl in the middle of the
group, and they are all listening to what she is saying.
Let us listen too.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is quite true; Mr. Wesley <i>is</i> coming.
I went to the village for mother, and old Downs the
cobbler told me, and so did Mrs. Wilson at the shop.
Everybody is talking about it."</p>

<p>"Ay, but that's good news, lassie!" the old farmer
says. "I wonder now if he'd come and preach at
Sycamore Farm."</p>

<p>The picture has gone.</p>

<p>Oh, but here's the other one. Why, it is the same
old farmhouse, and the sun is shining on the whitewashed
walls and funny little windows. There is
a great crowd gathered under the shade of the leafy
sycamores. See, there is the kind-looking farmer,
with his sunburnt face, and sitting on his knee is
Annie, the little girl that brought the good news
from the village. Right in the midst of the crowd
is Mr. Wesley, telling these country-people the story
of the Cross.</p>

<p>Now that picture has gone too.</p>

<p>Should we not have liked to have been at that
service?</p>

<p>I will tell you what Mr. Wesley said about it.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 334px;">
<img src="images/i-144.png" width="334" height="500" alt="&quot;In the midst of the crowd is Mr. Wesley, telling these country-people the story of the Cross.&quot;&mdash;Page 124." title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;In the midst of the crowd is Mr. Wesley, telling these country-people the story of the Cross.&quot;&mdash;<a href="#Page_124">Page 124</a>.</span>
</div>

<p>"It was a hot summer day, and we could see the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
blue, blue sky through the leaves of the old sycamores,
which shaded us from the heat. Just as I began to
preach, a little bird perched on a branch close by and
began to sing. I went on preaching, but its song did
not end, it sang on and on, and not until the service
was quite over did it cease. It was the best music
for such a church and such a congregation, no harp
or organ ever sounded half so sweet."</p>

<p>From Westmoreland, where this happened, to
Cornwall is a long way, but not too far for Mr. Wesley
and his horse. He used often to ride sixty miles
a day; and most of his reading, and the composing
of his sermons was done while he was on horseback.
He travelled in this way for more than forty years,
and must have gone over 100,000 miles.</p>

<p>In Gwennap, a place in Cornwall, Mr. Wesley
found a lovely out-of-doors sort of chapel. Some of
my readers will have seen the Happy Valley at
Llandudno; I think the Gwennap chapel must have
been something like that, only a great deal bigger.
This is what Mr. Wesley wrote about his first service
there:</p>

<p>"I stood on a wall, in the calm, still evening, with
the setting sun behind, and a great, great multitude
before, behind, and on either hand, sitting on the
hills all round. All could hear quite distinctly, when
I read to them Christ's own words: 'The disciple
is not above his Master,' and 'He that taketh not his
cross and followeth after Me is not worthy of Me.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Must it not have been a wonderful sight?</p>

<p>Like other places, Cornwall did not always give
a kind welcome to the Methodists; indeed, they
had sometimes to put up with very rough treatment.
Often they had to go without food, and the hard floor
was their only bed.</p>

<p>Once, at a place called St. Ives, Mr. Wesley and
his helper, Mr. Nelson, slept on the floor for a whole
fortnight. One of them had an overcoat rolled up
for a pillow, and the other a big book. They used
to get very sore, and sometimes could not sleep for
the pain in their poor aching bones. But these
Methodists had never heard of Grumble Corner,&mdash;they
only knew Thanksgiving Street; and so, instead
of murmuring and complaining, one night, when the
floor seemed harder than ever, Mr. Wesley called
out: "Let us cheer up, Brother Nelson, for the skin
is only off one side yet."</p>

<p>Another time, when no one had asked them to
dinner or tea, and they were riding through a country
lane, feeling very hungry, Mr. Wesley stopped his
horse to gather some blackberries, saying to his friend:
"Brother Nelson, we ought to be thankful that there
are plenty of blackberries, for this is the best country
I ever saw for getting an appetite, but the worst for
getting food."</p>

<p>On the whole, however, the Cornish people were
not unkind to Mr. Wesley. At St. Ives they once
gave him a very noisy welcome, shouting, "Hurrah!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
hurrah!" and then going under his bedroom window
and singing:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"John Wesley is come to town,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To try if he can pull the churches down."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>All this happened during his first visit to Cornwall;
and only once during the three weeks he was there
did he get really abused, and that was at St. Ives,
when the mob burst into his room, and a rough, cruel
man struck him on the head.</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/cap-i.png" width="100" height="100" alt="I" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /> &nbsp; TOLD you in the last chapter what
a wonderful traveller Mr. Wesley was;
he could walk twenty-four miles a day
easily, in either hot or cold weather,
and his adventures on the roads would almost fill
a book.</div>

<p>On one of his later visits to Cornwall, he had
a terrible fight with the sea; this time he was riding
in a coach. He had promised to preach in St. Ives
at a certain time, and the only way to get there was
by crossing the sands when the tide was out. His
own driver being a stranger in the country, he engaged
a man named Peter Martin to drive him. When they
reached the sea-shore they found, to their dismay,
that the tide was coming in, and the sands they had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
to cross were already partly covered with water.
Peter, the old coachman, stopped the horses, and
told Mr. Wesley that it was not safe to go. Then
an old sea-captain tried to prevent them, begging
them to go back, or they would surely be drowned.</p>

<p>"No," said Mr. Wesley, "I've promised to preach
at St. Ives, and I must keep my promise. Take the
sea! Take the sea!" he shouted, putting his head
out of the carriage window.</p>

<p>In a moment, Peter whipped the horses, and dashed
into the waves. The wheels of the carriage kept
sinking in the deep pits and hollows in the sand,
while the horses, swimming in the water, snorted and
reared with fright, and every moment poor Peter
expected to be drowned.</p>

<p>Just at this terrible moment, Mr. Wesley put his
head out of the carriage window; his long white
hair&mdash;for he was an old man when this happened&mdash;was
dripping with the salt water, which ran down his
venerable face. He was calm and fearless, unmoved
by the roaring of the waves or the danger of the
situation.</p>

<p>"What is your name, driver?" he shouted.</p>

<p>"Peter, sir," shouted back the man.</p>

<p>"Peter," Mr. Wesley called out again, "fear not;
thou shalt not sink."</p>

<p>With spurring and whipping, the poor frightened,
tired horses at last brought them safely over.</p>

<p>When they reached St. Ives, Mr. Wesley's first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
care was to see to the comfort of his horses and
driver. He got warm clothing, and refreshments at
the inn for Peter, and comfortable stabling for his
weary horses; then, quite forgetting himself, wet
through with the dashing waves, he went off to the
chapel to preach.</p>

<p>While Mr. Wesley was in Cornwall he paid a flying
visit to the Scilly Isles. He went over in a fisherman's
boat, and sang to the rising and falling of the
waves:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"When passing through the watery deep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I ask in faith His promised aid;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The waves an awful distance keep,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And shrink from my devoted head.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Fearless, their violence I dare;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">They cannot harm,&mdash;for God is there."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>If you look in your Wesley's Hymn-Book, at hymn
272, you will find this verse.</div>

<p>You have all learnt, in your geographies, that
Land's End is the most southern point in England;
look at the very south of Cornwall, and you will
find it. Mr. Wesley was very fond of this wild,
rocky point, with oceans rolling on either side,&mdash;the
English Channel on the one, the mighty Atlantic
on the other. He paid a last visit to it when he
was an old, old man, eighty years or more. With
furrowed cheeks, white hair streaming in the wind,
and infirm limbs, he climbed over the steep rocks
to get a long, last look at his favourite spot, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
meeting of the waters. I believe hymn 59 was
composed by Mr. Wesley as he stood on Land's End;
this is one of the verses:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Lo! on a narrow neck of land,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">'Twixt two unbounded seas I stand,</span><br />

</div>

<p>But we are getting on too fast, and must go back
to the days when Mr. Wesley was <i>not</i> an old man.
All his time was spent in preaching up and down
the country, starting fresh societies, and encouraging
old ones; and almost everywhere he and his helpers
met with abuse and rough treatment.</p>

<p>In Manchester, which was even then a large and
important town, Mr. Wesley preached to several
thousands of people in the open air. At this meeting,
his hearers either got tired of listening or they took
offence at what he said, for, before he had finished,
they threatened to bring out the fire-engine and
squirt water upon him if he did not stop.</p>

<p>At Hull, on his first visit in 1752, lumps of earth
and stones were thrown at him while he was preaching;
and when the service was over, the mob followed
him, shouting, hooting, and throwing stones until he
reached his lodging.</p>

<p>Though Mr. Wesley could be as brave as a lion
when it was necessary, he could also be as gentle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
as a lamb. Once, when he was preaching at Dewsbury,
a man rushed up to him in a terrible rage, and struck
him with all his might on the side of his face. It was
such a hard blow that poor Mr. Wesley could not
keep the tears from coming into his eyes. Instead
of striking the man back or using angry words, he
just did what Christ said we should do, he turned
his other cheek (Matt. v. 39). The enraged man
was so surprised at such unexpected gentleness, that
he turned away and hid his face with shame, and
was ever after one of the Methodists' greatest friends.
Once he even risked his life to save one of their
chapels from being destroyed.</p>

<p>Another time, when Mr. Wesley was at Falmouth
in Cornwall, he called to see an invalid lady. The
mob heard where he was, and surrounded the house,
shrieking out: "Bring out the Canorum! Where is
the Canorum?" This was a nickname which the
Cornishmen had given the Methodists. With sticks
and stones the mob tried to break open the front
door of the poor sick lady's house; and while they
were doing this, all the people in the house escaped
by the backway, except Mr. Wesley and a servant
girl. The girl did not like to leave Mr. Wesley alone
in this great danger, and begged him to get away
and hide himself. But John Wesley was not one
of the "hiding" sort. Instead of that, as soon as
they had succeeded in bursting the door open, he just
walked straight among the mob, exclaiming: "Here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
I am! What have you got to say to me? To which
of you have I done any wrong?"</p>

<p>He made his way out into the street bare-headed,
talking all the time; and before he had finished, the
ringleader of the mob declared no one should touch
him, he would be his protector. So he reached his
lodgings in safety.</p>

</div><div class='unindent'><br />E have been travelling all over England
with Mr. Wesley, now I think we must
go back to London with him. The
society there was still the largest in the
country: in the year I am writing about (1744),
they had one thousand nine hundred and fifty
members. Mr. Wesley very much wished to visit
every one of these members, and asked his brother
Charles to go with him. They started their visiting
at six o'clock every morning, and did not leave off
till six o'clock at night.</div>

<p>Six o'clock a.m. seems a funny time to call and
see any one, does it not? But you see people used
to get up at four or five in the morning in those days,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and used to go to bed at eight, so it was not really
such a funny time as it seems.</p>

<p>Though Mr. John and Mr. Charles started so
early and worked so late, it took them a long, long
time to visit all those 1950 members, and when they
had finished, Mr. Wesley realised for the first time
how his work had grown. He saw it was impossible,
even with his brother's help, to manage all the
preachers and all the members scattered over the
country, when even the work in London was more
than he could undertake alone. He thought about
this a great deal, and then he asked four clergymen
and four of his helpers, or what we should call local
preachers, to meet him and his brother at the Foundry,
to talk things over and decide what ought to be
done. These gentlemen accepted his invitation, and
there, on that eventful Monday in June, 1744, the
first Methodist Conference met; and from that
time up to the present, no year has passed but
Methodist preachers and helpers have gathered
together to make plans and talk business.</p>

<p>I am sure you must all have heard of the Wesleyan
Methodist Conference, which is now held every July
or August in some one or other of the large towns
of England. This first conference was opened with
solemn prayer and a sermon by Mr. Charles Wesley;
then all the difficulties of the work were talked over,
and arrangements made for the future. Mr. John
Wesley presided, and for forty-six years after, at every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
conference, their beloved leader and head took the
chair at this annual gathering.</p>

<p>You will think that what with travelling and
preaching, and looking after his helpers, and visiting
the members, Mr. Wesley could not find time for
much else. But it is always the busiest people who
have the most time. As I told you before, Mr.
Wesley began his days very early, getting up at four
o'clock; and by doing this every morning for sixty
years, he managed not only to preach, and read, and
visit, but also to write a great many books, and
thousands of tracts&mdash;one of his books was called
"Lessons for Children." Many of the tracts were
about swearing and Sabbath-breaking, and printed on
the outside were the words, "Not to be sold, but
given away"; and he and his preachers used to
carry them in their pockets and give them to the
people they passed on the roads.</p>

<p>Another reason why Mr. Wesley had more time
than most people was, because he</p>

<div class='center'>
NEVER WASTED A MINUTE,<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>and though he did so much work, he was <i>never in
a hurry</i>. He used to say, "I have no time to be in
a hurry." Hurry you know does not always mean
speed; when things are done in a hurry they are
often only half done, and have to be done all over
again.</div>

<p>You remember how the miners at Kingswood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
collected money and built a school for their children.
Well, about ten years afterwards, another school was
built at Kingswood for the children of the travelling
preachers. These preachers had not much time to
look after their families themselves, being so much
away from home, and they wanted their boys and
girls to be taught to read their Bibles and to learn
to love Jesus. They had some dreadfully strict rules
at this boarding school, which my readers would not
have liked at all, and which I am afraid the children
there did not like either, for I have heard that some
of the boys ran away. They had to go to bed every
night at eight o'clock, and what was worse, get up every
morning at four. Then every little boy and girl, unless
they were poorly, had to fast every Friday, that is,
they were not allowed to have anything to eat all
day until three o'clock. But I had better not tell you
any more of these dreadful rules, only you may be
very thankful that you are living in these days, when
you have much better times than the boys and girls
who lived 150 years ago.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/cap-i.png" width="100" height="100" alt="I" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />N 1749 Mr. Wesley paid a visit to Ireland,
where already he had many followers.
His brother Charles had visited there two
years before, and was a great favourite,
for the Irish people love music, and would always
go to hear his hymns.</div>

<p>In many places in Ireland the Methodists were
treated quite as badly as they were in our own
country; but the same angel of the Lord that protected
them in England followed them across the Irish sea.</p>

<p>There is a funny story told of how they were
once saved from a band of rough men. The Roman
Catholics persecuted them so much at Wexford that
they were obliged to hold their meeting secretly in
a barn. Once, one of their persecutors got to know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the night they were having a meeting, and told his
companions he would hide himself in the barn before
the service began, and then when it commenced he
would open the door to them. They thought this
was a splendid idea. So the man went to the barn,
and there found an old sack or bag, big enough for
him to get into. Into this he crept, and by and by
the people began to come, and the service commenced.
First, they sang a hymn; and somehow the man in
the bag enjoyed it so much, he quite forgot what
he had come into the barn for.</p>

<p>He listened until the hymn was finished, and then
he listened to the prayer that followed, and after
that he could not listen any more. He couldn't get
out of the bag, and he couldn't do anything but
groan and cry. God, through the hymn and the
prayer, had touched his heart, and he felt himself
to be the greatest sinner in Ireland.</p>

<p>So he groaned and groaned, and at last some
of the congregation heard him. They looked
towards the place where the mysterious sound came
from, but could see nothing except what looked
like a sack of potatoes. Still the groaning went on,
and some of the people got frightened, and were quite
sure there was a bogie in the barn. At last one or
two ventured to go nearer to the sack, then some
one peeped in, and the poor trembling Irishman was
discovered. He confessed to his purpose in hiding
himself, told them God had stopped him in his evil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
plan, and begged them to pray for him. So the
service was turned into a prayer-meeting, the man
was converted, and became one of the best Methodists
in Wexford.</p>

<p>Some of my readers will be wondering if Mr. John
or Mr. Charles Wesley were ever married, and if they
had any boys and girls of their own. Just before Mr.
Wesley went to Ireland in 1749, he married his
brother Charles to the daughter of a Welsh gentleman,
and Mr. Wesley, himself, was married two years
later to a lady who was a widow. You will be sorry
to hear that this lady was not at all nice; she treated
her husband most unkindly, and made him very
unhappy. Though Mr. Wesley was so fond of children,
he never had any of his own. Mr. Charles had eight,
but only three lived to grow up. His wife was a good,
kind lady, and they were very happy. He did not
travel about so much after he was married, but spent
a great deal of his time writing his beautiful hymns.</p>

<p>These two brothers always remained the best of
friends. In one of his letters, Charles wrote to John:
"I wish we could be oftener together; it might be
better for us both. Let us be useful in our lives,
and at our death not divided."</p>

<p>Before I close this chapter I want to tell you of
the first two black men who were converted through
the preaching of a Methodist.</p>

<p>Living at Wandsworth, a little place near London
where Mr. Wesley had gone to preach, was a gentleman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
named Nathaniel Gilbert. He had come from
the West Indies, where he employed a great many
negroes. Two of these negroes he had brought over
to England with him, and when Mr. Wesley paid
a visit to Mr. Gilbert, and preached in his house,
these two black men were converted. When they
returned to the West Indies, they, along with Mr.
Gilbert, preached the gospel of Jesus Christ to the
dark people in those far-away islands.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Runaway horses.&mdash;Two frightened little girls.&mdash;A terrible moment.&mdash;Safe.&mdash;Psalm

<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/cap-o.png" width="100" height="100" alt="O" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />NE more story of how the angel that shut
the lions' mouths for Daniel took care
of God's dear servant, John Wesley. He
was staying at Newcastle with a Methodist
named Mr. Smith, who had married his step-daughter.
One day a party of them drove to a village a few
miles off. In the carriage there was Mr. Wesley and
a friend, Mr. and Mrs. Smith and their two little girls.
When they had driven about two miles and were
just at the top of a hill, suddenly the horses took
fright, and dashed down the steep road. The poor
coachman was thrown off the box, and the horses
tore away at full speed, sometimes swerving to the
edge of a ditch on one side of the road, then back
again to a ditch on the other, but never once going
over. When a cart came along, instead of running<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
into it, the carriage passed as if the driver had been
on the box.</div>

<p>At the bottom of the hill was a narrow bridge,
which it seemed impossible the panting horses could
cross safely. But exactly down the middle they
went, swerving neither to the right or left. Then up
the hill on the other side they dashed, passing many
people on the road, but every one afraid to stop their
mad career. Near the top of this hill was a gate,
which led into a farmer's yard. The gate stood open,
and turning sharp, the horses ran through without
even touching gate or post. The gate on the other
side of the yard was shut, and the terrified people
in the carriage thought the horses would now be
checked. Instead of that, they rushed through, breaking
it up as if it had only been a spider's web, and
galloped on through the corn-field.</p>

<p>The two little girls had been almost too frightened
to speak, now they clung to Mr. Wesley, crying out:
"Oh grandpapa, save us! save us!" Mr. Wesley, who
says he felt no more afraid than if he had been sitting
in his study, just calmly said to them: "Nothing will
hurt you, dears; don't be afraid." The horses galloped
madly on, till they came to the edge of a steep
precipice. Would they go over? What would they
do? Oh, what a terrible moment of suspense.</p>

<p>A gentleman on horseback seeing their danger, just
galloped across the track of the frightened animals.
This acted like magic; they stood still at once, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
every one was safe. A few minutes more and they
would have been dashed to pieces. When they turned
back into the road they found the coachman coming
to meet them, and no worse for his fall.</p>

<p>Did not God keep His promise to the man who
had "set his love upon Him"? "<i>He shall give His
angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways:
they shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash
thy foot against a stone.</i>"&mdash;Psalm xci. 11, 12.</p>

<p>Mr. Wesley was an old man when this happened,
just seventy-two; it was in June, and his birthday
was on the 17th. But he was so strong and well,
not at all like an old man. Listen to what he says
of himself: "This is my birthday, the first day of
my seventy-second year, and I am wondering how
it is that I am just as strong as I was thirty years
ago. Indeed, I am better than I was then; I can
see better, and my nerves are firmer. The grand
cause is 'the good pleasure of God.' But three special
things have helped to keep me young:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class='hang1'><i>First</i>&mdash;Getting up at 4 o'clock every morning for
fifty years.</div>

<div class='hang1'><i>Second</i>&mdash;Preaching every morning at five o'clock.</div>

<div class='hang1'><i>Third</i>&mdash;Travelling by sea or land 4,500 miles in
every year."</div></div>

<p>These are funny things to keep any one young,
are they not? I am afraid if to follow these rules
is the only way to keep young, most of my readers
will be content to grow old.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Little Mary and what she did with her money.&mdash;Caught on the
stairs.&mdash;Cheered by the children.&mdash;Boys and girls converted.</p></div>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/cap-i.png" width="100" height="100" alt="I" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /> &nbsp; N the year 1770 the Methodists had grown
so numerous that they counted forty-nine
different circuits or societies in
England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales.
They had one hundred and twenty-two travelling
preachers, and twice as many local preachers, who
did not travel, and at the covenant service which
Mr. Wesley held at the beginning of this year in
London, there were eighteen hundred members
present.</div>

<p>Mr. Wesley, like our ministers nowadays, was
often wanting money for different purposes, and,
like our ministers too, he was always glad of the
children's help. Once, when the Foundry wanted
repairing, he specially asked for help at an evening
service. A little girl named Mary heard him, and
thought how much she would like to do something.
And this is how she managed it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Wesley loved children, and used to keep a
number of bright new coins in his pocket to give to
the little folks he met at his friends' houses. Mary
had always been a great favourite with Mr. Wesley,
and a proud little girl she was when he took her on
his knee and gave her a silver penny. He had often
done this, and she had treasured up his gifts in
a little box. Other friends, too, had sometimes given
her money, which, instead of spending she had
saved up.</p>

<p>Well, when she got home after that evening service,
she counted up her money, and found she had &pound;3.
So she went to her mother and asked if she might
give it all to Mr. Wesley. Her mother was quite
willing; so the next morning little Mary carried her
savings to Mr. Wesley's room. Tears came into his
eyes as he thanked his little favourite. Taking her
in his arms, he kissed her very tenderly, and prayed
that God's blessing might always rest upon her. And
it did, for Mary grew up to be an earnest, happy
Christian.</p>

<p>Here is another story that shows how much Mr.
Wesley loved the young folks. He was once staying
in a house in Bristol where a little boy and girl were
visiting. The little girl had long, beautiful hair hanging
in curls down her back. She and her brother were
running hand in hand down the stairs one day, when
Mr. Wesley ran down after them and caught them
on the landing. He jumped the little girl in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
arms and kissed her; then putting his hand on the
boy's head, he blessed him. Little Robert did not
think much about this at the time, I dare say, but
when he grew up, he felt all his life that the blessing
of a good man rested upon him, and his eyes glistened
with tears when he told the story. That little boy
was the poet Southey, of whom you will read when
you are older.</p>

<p>When Mr. Wesley wanted recreation or a kind of
holiday, he used to go off to Kingswood. A few
days among the young folks there always cheered
him, and did him good. He loved to hear their
lessons and praise their work, and arranged easy
grammars and history books for them.</p>

<p>A great many people used to think then, as a few
do now, that children could not be converted, and
that they ought not to be members of society. Mr.
Wesley never thought so. At Weardale he allowed
thirty children to become members. At another place
quite a number of boys and girls came to him after
the preaching, wanting him to show them how they
could belong to Jesus. Mr. Wesley had both then
and always the words of Jesus Himself, before him,
"Suffer the little children to come unto Me, and forbid
them not;" and so he knelt down with those boys
and girls and led them to the Good Shepherd, who
had laid down His life for them.</p>

<p>The children of Judea loved Jesus, and were glad
to be with Him; and Mr. Wesley was so like Jesus,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
so loving and so kind, that the children of England
could not help loving him, and were glad to be with
him. A whole crowd once waited in the street a long
time for him, and when at last he came, they all
followed him like so many little lambs after their
shepherd, as many as could clinging to him. They
went to the meeting-house with him, and after the
service was over would not leave until they had all
shaken hands with him.</p>

<p>"In Cornwall, Manchester, and Epworth," Mr.
Wesley says, "numbers of children were converted."</p>

<p>These verses apply to all my readers:</p>

each other."</div>

<p>Mr. Wesley, with his long white hair and beautiful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
face, looked and spoke so lovingly, that the boys
did at once what he asked them.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "put your arms round each other's
necks, and kiss each other."</p>

<p>And the little boys did this too. He was just
having his tea when Mrs. Bush brought in the culprits,
and now taking two pieces of bread and butter, he
folded them together and told each boy to break
a piece off. Then he gave each of them a drink of
tea out of his own cup.</p>

<p>"Now," he added, "you have broken bread
together, and you have drunk out of the same cup,
now you must be friends." Then he put his hands
on the boys' heads and blessed them. The next
morning at family prayer he sought out the boys
and blessed them again.</p>

<p>The two lads never forgot this meeting with Mr.
Wesley. One of them became a magistrate, and
when he had children of his own he used to tell them
this story of his school-days.</p>

<p>I remember that little verse of Dr. Watts' being
recited to my brothers and me when we were in the
nursery, and as I wrote it down I wondered if the
same thoughts came into the heads of those school-boys
that came into mine. My dear mother used
to look very serious when she said it, and it sounded
very solemn. But I had often seen little birds quarrelling,
and I knew that hymn did not tell the truth,
and so I felt little birds were hardly a proper example<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
to follow. Now, though Dr. Watts was not quite
correct, still little birds do agree very much better
than many children; and if they sometimes quarrel,
remember they are only guided by instinct, while you
have sense, and know the difference between right
and wrong.</p>

<p>You will all be glad to know that before Mr.
Wesley died, all the ill-will and hatred of the people
had changed to love and reverence. The very towns
where he had been treated most unkindly were now
the ones to give him the heartiest welcome. Instead
of mobs waiting to abuse him, crowds gathered to
do him honour. In many places the children had
a holiday from school, the tradespeople closed their
shops, and everybody tried who could best show
their love and respect for the man whom before they
had treated so unkindly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>More peeps into the Magic Mirror.&mdash;A special picture for Sheffield
readers.&mdash;Another for young folks in Oldham.&mdash;Little Daniel on the
pulpit stairs.&mdash;Special for Hull.</p></div>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/cap-i.png" width="100" height="100" alt="I" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /> &nbsp; THINK we must have some more peeps
into that Magic Mirror? Will my little
Sheffield readers take a good look? What
do we see? A street in a big town, and
oh! such crowds and crowds of people on both sides
of the road. The windows of the houses, too, are
all crowded with people. What can it all mean? See!
there are two men coming along, everybody is turning
to look at them, and we can hear more than one
voice saying: "God bless him! God bless him!"
Several of the women are wiping their eyes with the
corner of their aprons; there are tears in many eyes.
Look at the two men as they come nearer. One is
a middle-aged man; the other, who is leaning on
his arm, wears a black gown and white bands. He
is an old man, but how beautiful he looks. He has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
a splendid face, a clear skin and rosy cheeks. His
eyes are quick and keen, and he has long, shiny hair,
white and bright like silver.</div>

<p>See now how the children are crowding round him!
He is smiling down upon them and putting his hands
upon their heads as he passes. Now he is stretching
his hands out towards heaven, and blessing all the
people, many of whom are weeping aloud. He has
passed down the street, and the picture has gone.
Sheffield readers, that was how your town welcomed
and honoured dear John Wesley a short time before
his death.</p>

<p>Now peep again into the Magic Mirror. And this
time I would like my Oldham readers to step to
the front. See, there is a little boy about six years
old playing at the door of a house. An old clergyman
is passing, and stops to speak to the child.</p>

<p>"Where is your father, Daniel?" he says.</p>

<p>"Gone to chapel."</p>

<p>"And your mother?"</p>

<p>"She's gone too," answers Daniel.</p>

<p>"And you shall go too, my boy. You must not
miss seeing this great man, John Wesley," says the
clergyman, as he takes the child's hand and fades
away from our picture.</p>

<p>But see, there is another coming! It is the inside
of a chapel, and people are everywhere; in the galleries,
in the aisles, in the communion rails, everywhere.
On the pulpit-stairs some one has found room<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
for a little child. Why, it is Daniel, and there is
the kind clergyman standing near. See, the preacher
has finished, and is coming down from the pulpit,
he is lifting up the little child and is kissing him.
Now, he has passed into the vestry, and the picture
has gone. That, my young Oldham readers, was
the opening of Manchester St. Chapel on Good
Friday, 1790, when Mr. Wesley was nearly ninety
years old.</p>

<p>At Hull, Birmingham, Wednesbury, Chester, Manchester,
Liverpool, all places where the Methodists
had been most cruelly treated, Mr. Wesley and his
followers were now most kindly welcomed. You
remember how Mr. Wesley and his brother had been
shut out of the churches, very few clergymen allowing
them to preach in their pulpits. This, too, was all
changed.</p>

<p>Those of you who live in Hull will like to know
that John Wesley, when he was eighty-three, was
invited by the vicar to preach in your beautiful High
Church. If any of you have not been inside&mdash;but
surely all my Hull readers have&mdash;pay it a visit, and
just fancy you see that bright-eyed, silver-haired old
man, with a voice that had lost little of the strength
of youth, preaching to the crowds that thronged the
hallowed place. If those old grey walls could speak,
we might know John Wesley's very words. He
preached again at night, and though so old, was
unwearied with his work. He went on to Beverley<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
that same evening, and the next day travelled seventy-six
miles, preached at Malton, Pocklington, and
Swinefleet, and went to bed without feeling the least
bit tired. Wonderful John Wesley! God-blest John
Wesley!</p>

hear that Mr. Wesley did not pass by
your dear little town. Indeed, there is
a house in Norwood where he most probably
stayed, and certainly visited; the home of Mr.
and Mrs. Barton. You shall see an exact copy of
a letter he wrote to these friends. It has never been
printed before, so you are the first of the public to
see it. It is addressed thus:</div>

<div class='poem'>
"<span class="smcap">Mrs. Jane Barton,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"In Norwood, Beverley,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">"Yorkshire.</span>"</span><br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>You must not make a mistake and think that Mr.
Wesley was Mrs. Jenny Barton's brother really;
but it was the custom among the Methodists for
the members of society to address each other as
"Brother So-and-So" and "Sister So-and-So," meaning
that they were brothers and sisters in having
the same heavenly Father, and loving the same
Saviour.</p>

<p>John Wesley preached in a meeting-house in Wood
Lane, which you can still see, though it is now turned
into cottages; and we may be quite sure that the
boys and girls who lived in Beverley then, heard his
loving words, and received his blessing. He once
spent two days of his birthday month in your quaint
old town. The June sun stole through the stained
windows of the beautiful Minster, and looked into
the jackdaws' nests on St. Mary's Tower.</p>

<p>There is a funny story told of this last visit, which
he paid only a few months before his death. He was
going to preach in Hull again, and forty friends from
that town had come over to see him. They were all
to have dinner together in the red-roofed inn where
he was staying, and then drive back with him to
Hull. Everybody was very merry, and they laughed
and talked so much that they quite forgot all about
the time. Suddenly, Mr. Wesley looked at his watch,
then jumped up from the dinner table, shouted good-bye
to his friends, stepped into his carriage, which
had been waiting some time for him at the door,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and was off before his astonished friends could say
a word. Their horses and carriages were got ready
with all speed, but it was only by driving very fast
that they managed to overtake Mr. Wesley before
he rode into Hull.</p>

<p>Punctuality was one of Mr. Wesley's strongest
points. He could never bear to be a minute behind
time. Once, when his carriage did not come punctually,
he was heard to say: "I have lost ten minutes
for ever."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 98px;">
<img src="images/cap-n.png" width="98" height="100" alt="N" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />OW I must come to what seems to the
young a very sad time. When we are
strong and healthy, and can enjoy all
the things God has given us to enjoy
in this beautiful world, death does seem very sad
and sorrowful. But think, dear young readers,
how you feel when you have been playing hard all
day, or working at school, and perhaps gone to a
party in the evening and have not got to bed until
10 o'clock. Is it not very nice and very comforting
to lay your head on your soft pillow and go to sleep?
Now this is just how God's people feel when they
are tired of life's work, they just close their eyes and
fall asleep, "asleep in Jesus." This is how Mr. Charles
Wesley passed away when he was eighty years old.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Though four years younger than Mr. John, he seemed
the older man, for he had been weak and infirm for
a long time. The two brothers had loved each other
dearly, and Mr. Wesley felt very lonely when
"Charlie" died.</div>

<p>Three weeks afterwards, Mr. Wesley, preaching at
Bolton, gave out for his second hymn No. 140, a hymn
composed by Mr. Charles. He tried to read the
first verse, but when he came to the words</p>

<div class='poem'>
"My company before is gone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And I am left alone with Thee,"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unident'>he could get no further, but just burst into tears,
and sat down in the pulpit, burying his face in his
hands. The singing ceased, and numbers of the congregation
wept in sympathy at sight of their dear
leader's sorrow. At last Mr. Wesley recovered himself,
and went on with the service, which was never forgotten
by any of those who were present.</div>

<p>Very soon after this, Mr. Wesley began to feel weak
and feeble. Again his birthday month came round,
the sunny month of June, and on the 17th he wrote:
"I am eighty-six to-day, and I find I grow old. My
eyes are so dim that no spectacles will help me, and
I cannot read small print except in a very strong
light. My strength fails me so that I walk much
slower than I used to do." He was now, for the
first time for forty years, obliged to give up his
five o'clock morning sermons, and was only able to
preach twice a day. As the months went by, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
grew weaker and more infirm. Once, as the old man
tottered up the pulpit stairs, the whole congregation
burst into tears.</p>

<p>On Valentine's Day, in 1790, he preached one of
his last sermons to his <i>little</i> followers. He chose for
his text: "Come, ye children, hearken unto Me: I will
teach you the fear of the Lord." The boys and girls
flocked from everywhere to hear him, and many who
had never loved Jesus before, heard Him speaking to
them through His dear servant; and answering the
loving call, came, and from that day became Christ's
faithful little soldiers.</p>

<p>In the same year, when he was eighty-seven years
old, he spent a week-end in Manchester, and spoke
his last words to his followers there. He preached
in the old chapel in Oldham Street on the Saturday
night, and the next day, which was Easter Sunday
(April 4th), he assisted in giving the Sacrament to
sixteen hundred members, and preached both night
and morning without feeling tired.</p>

<p>A few months later he preached at Colchester; but
he was so infirm that a minister had to stand on each
side of him, and hold him up. His voice was feeble
and low, and many of the congregation could not
hear him; but his calm, beautiful face, and long
white hair formed a picture that the children and
grown-up people in Colchester never forgot.</p>

<p>It was in this same year, 1790, that he preached
for the last time in the open air. It was in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Winchelsea, and the time was October, the month
when nuts and apples are asking to be gathered, and
when the leaves put on their loveliest dress.</p>

<p>As Mr. Wesley felt his time on earth was drawing
to a close, he was all the more eager to "tell to all
around, what a dear Saviour he had found," and how
they might find Him too. So he preached at twelve
o'clock noon, the dinner hour of the workmen, in
order that they too might have a chance of hearing
the good news. A large oak dining-table was brought
into the churchyard, and there, under the shade of an
old ash tree, John Wesley gave his last message to
those working men. "<i>The kingdom of Heaven is at
hand; repent ye, and believe the Gospel</i>," was his text,
and as he preached, the tears of the people flowed
down their cheeks.</p>

<p>Long, long afterwards the old ash tree was known
as "Wesley's Tree," and the vicar of Winchelsea had
hard work to keep it from being cut to pieces; for
Methodists use to come from all parts to cut a twig
in remembrance of that last scene in the life of the
venerable field-preacher.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/cap-m.png" width="100" height="100" alt="M" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />OST people think it is time to stop working
long before they are eighty, but John
Wesley at eighty-seven still went about
his "Father's business." His constant
prayer was, "Lord, let me not live to be useless."
Every meeting he knew might be his last, and
when he visited the different societies, he used
to ask the members to take as his last advice: "To
love as brothers, to fear God, and to honour the
King." He closed nearly all these meetings with
his brother's hymn:</div>

<div class='poem'>
"O that without a lingering groan,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I may the welcome Word receive;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">My body with my charge lay down,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And cease at once to work and live."</span><br />
</div>

<p>John Wesley's last sermon was preached in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
gentleman's dining-room, at Leatherhead, a small
place about eighteen miles from London. It was
on February 23rd, 1791, and his text was, "<i>Seek ye
the Lord while He may be found, call upon Him while
He is near.</i>"&mdash;Isa. lv. 6. This was on a Wednesday,
and the day but one after, Friday, he felt very poorly,
and said he would like to lie down. At the end of
half an hour, some one went to his bedroom, and
found him so ill that they sent for the doctor. On
Sunday he seemed better, and got up. He was so
cheerful and happy; and while sitting in his chair
in his bedroom, he repeated a verse from one of his
brother's hymns:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Till glad I lay this body down,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Thy servant, Lord, attend;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And oh! my life of mercy crown</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With a triumphant end!"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>On Monday night he couldn't sleep, and the next
day, some one asked him if he had any pain.</div>

<p>"No," he answered. And then he began singing:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"All glory to God in the sky,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And peace upon earth be restored;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">O, Jesus exalted on high,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Appear our omnipotent Lord.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Who meanly in Bethlehem born,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Didst stoop to redeem a lost race;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Once more to Thy people return,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And reign in Thy kingdom of grace."</span><br />
</div>

<p>When he had sung two verses, he lay still. After
awhile he said, "I want to write."</p>

<p>So they brought him ink and paper, and put the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
pen in his hand; but John Wesley's writing days
were over.</p>

<p>"I cannot," he said.</p>

<p>"Let me write for you," said one of his friends,
"tell me what you want to say."</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied the dying Christian, "but that
God is with us."</p>

<p>In the morning he wanted to get up, and while
his friends were bringing him his clothes, he started
to sing:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"I'll praise my Maker while I've breath,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And, when my voice is lost in death,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Praise shall employ my nobler powers;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">My days of praise shall ne'er be past,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">While life, and thought, and being last,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Or immortality endures.</span><br />
<br />
"Happy the man, whose hopes rely<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">On Israel's God: He made the sky,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And earth and sea, with all their train;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">His truth for ever stands secure;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He saves the opprest, He feeds the poor,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And none shall find His promise vain."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14.5em;"><i>Hymn 224.</i></span><br />
</div>

<p>When he was dressed and seated in his chair, he
prayed in a very weak voice: "Lord, Thou givest
strength to those who can speak, and to those who
cannot; speak, Lord, to all our hearts."</p>

<p>Then he tried to sing again, but his voice failed
him.</p>

<p>He was soon tired of sitting up, and went back to
bed. He could not talk very much; but twice he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
lifted his hand in triumph, and said so gladly: "The
best of all is, God is with us."</p>

<p>A great many friends were standing round his
bed; he took each one by the hand, and lovingly
bade them farewell.</p>

<p>All through Tuesday night, he kept trying to
repeat the hymn he had sung, but could only say:
"I'll praise, I'll praise."</p>

<p>Next morning, about ten o'clock, the Rev. Joseph
Bradford, who had been his faithful companion and
nurse, knelt down at the bedside and prayed. Eleven
of Mr. Wesley's friends were in the room; they
wanted to go with their dear leader, right up to
the gates that divide our life here from our life
yonder.</p>

<p>"Farewell," said the dying patriarch. And then,
as some one repeated, "Lift up your heads, O ye
gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and
this Heir of glory shall come in," the Golden Gates
opened, and the soul of John Wesley passed through.</p>

<p>Those who were left outside the gates, still stood
round the bed and sang to the departing spirit:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Waiting to receive thy spirit,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Lo, the Saviour stands above;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Shows the purchase of His merit,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Reaches out the crown of love."</span><br />
</div>

<p>So died happy John Wesley. Happy in life,
happy in death. And the secret of his happiness
was the secret he proclaimed to thousands of boys<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
and girls, as well as men and women, all over this
England of ours.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"O boys, be strong in Jesus;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Let those around you see</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">How manly, pure, and generous,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A Christian boy can be.</span><br />
<br />
"O maidens, live for Jesus,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And let the love from God above</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Rule all you say and do.</span><br />
<br />
"Then all the boys and maidens,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">When life and work are o'er,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Will hear from One, the words 'Well done,'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And rest for evermore."</span><br />
</div>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>If ever you go to London, you must visit City
Road Chapel, for there John Wesley was interred, on
the 9th of March, 1791, aged nearly eighty-eight
years.</p>

<p>A great deal was put on his tombstone which you
could not understand, but it tells how this servant of
God laboured to bring men and women to know
Jesus Christ, and how the lives and hearts of many
thousands were changed by his preaching.</p>

<p>In Westminster Abbey, too, you will see a marble
tablet erected to his memory, and that of his brother
Charles. Though churches shut their doors to him
in life, his memory is now so lovingly respected, that
the finest Cathedral in England has sought to do
him honour.</p>

<p>In one of the topmost rooms in the tower at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Kingswood School, John Wesley's bedstead has
recently been discovered. Merely a collection of
poles and a piece of old sacking, it lay there many
a long year, only seen by the man who went up the
tower to wind the clock. Now it is put together, and
set in a place of honour; and any of us may see
the bed on which John Wesley slept, when he visited
the boys and girls at Kingswood.</p>

<p>Here, too, we may see his chairs and books, and
a gown, now torn, which he used to wear. The
Governor of New Kingswood still sits in the high-backed
